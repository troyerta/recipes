## Notes

- Depending on how soft your avocado is and what ingredients you omit (corn or beans) you may need less salsa verde. Start with 1/2 cup and go from there. I can only find the salsa verde in a 7 oz can (which is just short of 1 cup, I use that can).

- This dip will last 1-2 days in the fridge before it will start turning brown. I would not make it the day before, but rather a few hours before you need it if you want to make it ahead of time.

- Feel free to add chopped cilantro and/or chopped jalapenos for more spice and flavor!
