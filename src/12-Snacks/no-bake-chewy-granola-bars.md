# No Bake Chewy Granola Bars

## Overview

- Yield: 18

## Ingredients

- 4 tbsp. (1/2 stick) unsalted butter or coconut oil

- 1/4 cup packed light brown sugar or brown rice syrup

- 1/4 cup honey

- 2 cups plain granola

- 1 cup rice cereal (Rice Krispies, etc.)

- 1/4 cup semisweet chocolate chips

- 1/4 cup peanut butter chips

## Method

1. Line two 9×5 loaf pans or one 11×7 inch baking pan (see tip #4 above if you want to use 9×13) with foil or parchment. Lightly butter or spray the foil.

2. Combine butter, honey and brown sugar in a large saucepan over medium heat. Stir until the butter is melted.
---

3. Bring the mixture to a boil, then lower the heat to medium-low and simmer until the sugar is dissolved, 2 minutes. Remove the saucepan from the heat.
---

4. Add the granola and rice cereal into the saucepan and fold them into the sauce until evenly coated.
---

5. Spread the mixture into the prepared pans and press firmly with a spatula to evenly fill. Sprinkle the chocolate and peanut butter chips onto the top of the granola and gently press them down with the spatula.
---

6. Let sit for 15-20 minutes or until mostly cooled and set*; lift out of the pan and cut into bars.

7. Recipe Note: If the bars are sticky but not quite holding together, place them in the fridge to harden for 10-15 minutes. I’ve noticed that on very warm days, the bars don’t always harden at room temperature, this is especially true if you use brown rice syrup.
---

8. Lower sugar version: Use low-sugar granola (see nutrition info below for recipe) and low-sugar brown rice cereal (found online and in health food stores). Reduce brown sugar and honey to 2 tablespoons each. If possible, replace brown sugar with brown rice syrup. Omit 2 tbsp. granola. Omit peanut butter chips, use 1/4 cup mini chocolate chips instead of regular size.
