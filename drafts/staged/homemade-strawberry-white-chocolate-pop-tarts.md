## Method

1. To make the strawberry jam. In a medium pot, bring the strawberries, raspberries, honey, and lemon juice to a boil. Boil 8-10 minutes or until the mixture has thickened and becomes jam-like. Stir in the vanilla and a pinch of salt. Let Cool.

2. To make the crust. In a food processor or blender, combine the flour and oats and pulse until the oats are mostly ground. Add the butter and pulse until the mix clumps together to form pea size balls. Add cold water, 1 tablespoon at a time until the dough comes together and forms a ball.

3. Turn the dough out onto a flour surface. Roll out into a 1/8-inch thickness. Cut the dough into rectangles, about 6 1/2 x 4 1/2 inches. Place a heaping tablespoon of the strawberry jam on one half of the rectangle, adding a white few chocolate chips, if desired. Lay the other half of the dough over the filling and seal the edges by crimping with the back of a fork. Repeat until you have used all the dough and jam. Place the pop tarts on parchment lined baking sheets. Cover the baking sheets and place in the fridge for 30 minutes to 1 hour.

4. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.

6. Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, whisk together the melted white chocolate, powder sugar and 2 tablespoons milk, adding extra milk to thin the glaze as desired. Drizzle the glaze over the pop tarts. Decorate as desired.
