## Ingredients

- 6 slices bacon, diced

- 4 cups all-purpose flour

- 1 cup shredded extra-sharp cheddar cheese

- 1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley leaves

- 4 teaspoons baking powder

- 2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper

- 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt

2. Heat a large skillet over medium high heat. Add bacon and cook until brown and crispy, about 6-8 minutes. Drain excess fat; transfer bacon to a paper towel-lined plate.

3. In a large bowl, combine bacon, flour, cheese, parsley, baking powder, pepper, salt, baking soda and garlic powder.

4. Grate butter using the large holes of a box grater. Stir into the flour mixture.

5. Add buttermilk and stir using a rubber spatula until a soft dough forms.

6. Working on a lightly floured surface, knead the dough 3-4 times until it comes together. Using a rolling pin, roll the dough into a 1 1/4-inch thick rectangle. Cut out 14-16 rounds using a 2-inch biscuit or cookie cutter. Place biscuits onto the prepared baking sheet; place in the freezer for 15 minutes.

7. Remove biscuits from freezer. Place into oven and bake for 14-17 minutes, or until golden brown.

8. Serve warm.
