# Buttery Beer Bread

## Overview

- Yield: 1 loaf
- Prep Time: 10 mins
- Cook Time: 50 mins
- Total Time: 1 hr

## Ingredients

- 3 cups all-purpose flour

- 1/4 cup sugar

- 1 tablespoon baking powder

- 1 teaspoon salt

- 1 bottle (12 ounces) beer

- 1 stick butter, melted (It calls for unsalted, but I only use salted)

## Method

1. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Grease a 9x5 inch loaf pan. Line with parchment paper for easy removal (optional).

2. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt. Using a wooden spoon, stir the beer into the dry ingredients until just mixed.
---
3. Pour half the melted butter into the bottom of the loaf pan. Then spoon the batter into the pan, and pour the rest of the butter on top of the batter.
---
4. Place loaf pan on cookie sheet in case there is any butter that spills over as it bakes.

5. Bake for 50 to 60 minutes, until golden brown and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Serve immediately with a smear of more butter, or reheat in the microwave for 20 seconds.
