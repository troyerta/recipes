## Overview

- Yield: 4 servings
- Prep Time: 15 mins
- Cook Time: 20 mins

## Ingredients

#### Cauliflower:

- 4 cups cauliflower florets

- 2 eggs

- 2 cups panko breadcrumbs

- Salt and pepper

- 1 scallion (thinly sliced)

#### Sauce:

- 2 tablespoons sweet chili sauce

- 2 teaspoons Sriracha hot sauce

- 1/2 cup mayonnaise

- 1/2 cup non-fat plain Greek yogurt

- Garnish (chopped parsley or cilantro)

## Method

1. Gather ingredients.
---

2. Preheat the oven to 425 F. Whisk together the eggs in a small bowl. Add the salt and pepper: about a teaspoon of each will do. Add about a teaspoon of water to thin out the eggs a little bit. The egg will stick better to the cauliflower this way.
---

3. Dip the cauliflower florets in the beaten eggs and coat them on all sides.
---

4. Drop the cauliflower florets into the panko breadcrumbs. Toss them to completely coat. The panko should coat the cauliflower pretty easily, but if you need to, you can press some more of the breadcrumbs onto the cauliflower.
---

5. Place the coated cauliflower on a parchment lined baking sheet. Leave a little space between each floret.
---

6. Spray the cauliflower with cooking spray and then bake for 15 to 20 minutes or until golden brown and crispy.
---

7. While the cauliflower is cooking, whisk together the ingredients to the bang bang sauce in a bowl.
---

8. Drizzle the bang bang sauce over the crispy cauliflower and top with chopped scallions and parsley. Then serve immediately...with more bang bang sauce on the side, of course!
---

## Notes

- You can add salt and pepper to the cauliflower and to the breadcrumbs for even more flavor.

- If you like it on the spicier side, add more Sriracha to the sauce.
