# Superfood Broccoli Salad with Poppy Seed Dressing

## Overview

- Yield: 6

## Ingredients

#### Poppyseed Dressing:

- ⅓ cup olive oil

- 3-4 tablespoons honey (agave or maple syrup)

- 3 tablespoons white wine vinegar

- 1 shallot, roughly chopped

- 1 tablespoon white miso paste

- 1 tablespoon poppy seeds

#### Broccoli Salad:

- 3 ½ – 4 cups fresh broccoli florets (~1½ pounds)

- 1 cup cooked quinoa, cooled (~1/3 cup dry)

- ½ cup sliced almonds

- ½ cup sunflower seeds

- ½ cup dried cranberries

## Method

1. Dressing: Combine all the ingredients for the dressing in a food processor starting with 3 tablespoons of honey and a big pinch of salt and pepper. Blend until the dressing is smooth. Taste and adjust with additional honey or salt and pepper as desired. I prefer this one with around 3½ tablespoons of honey.

2. Broccoli Salad: Steam the broccoli if you’d like, I did because I wanted it to have a more vibrant color. Combine the ingredients for the salad in a large bowl. Dress the entire salad if you’ll finish it all within 24 hours. Otherwise, mix just what you need and keep the two separate, they’ll last much longer this way.

## Notes

- This makes just enough dressing for this salad. If you usually prefer your salad with lots of dressing, you may want to double it. It’s so good you can easily use it on other salads too!

- Feel free to add grilled chicken or cooked salmon to this. Crumbled bacon and cheddar cheese are also additions that can easily be made
