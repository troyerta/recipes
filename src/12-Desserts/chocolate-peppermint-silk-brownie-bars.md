## Method

#### Make the brownie base:

1. Line a 9x5 inch pan with parchment paper, set aside.
---
2. Place pecans and cocoa in the bowl of food processor and grind until very finely ground (be careful to not over process the nuts into butter).
---
3. Add the rest of the ingredients and process until the dough starts to come together. Press firmly into parchment lined loaf pan.
---
4. Place in freezer while making the mousse and ganache topping.
---

#### Make the peppermint mousse:

1. Fill a large bowl with ice and cold water, set aside.
---
2. Combine chocolate and water in a medium-sized heat-proof bowl set over a medium-sized pan of simmering water (don’t let the bottom of the heat-proof bowl touch the water) and melt the mixture over low heat, stirring until fully melted and smooth.
---
3. Remove the mixing bowl sitting on top of the pan, wipe the bottom and carefully set into the ice water bowl. Add the peppermint extract.
---
4. Whisk the chocolate mixture for about 3 to 5 minutes or until it lightens in color and thickens and creates ribbons. Do not over-whip or your mixture will become grainy and break. (If you whip the mixture too long just place the bowl back onto the heat, re-melt and re-whip.)
---
5. Pour over brownie base and place in freezer while you make the ganache.
---

#### Make the chocolate ganache:
1. In the food processor, blend together maple syrup and coconut oil until well combined.
---
2. Add in cacao powder and a pinch of salt and process until smooth scraping down the sides as needed.
---
3. Pour over peppermint mousse and return pan to fridge to set and firm for at least one hour.
---
4. Cut into bars and serve. Keep leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge.
