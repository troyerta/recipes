# Country Apple Fritter Bread

Fluffy, buttery, white cake loaf loaded with chunks of apples and layers of brown sugar and cinnamon swirled inside and on top.

## Overview

- Yield: 8 servings
- Prep Time: 25 mins
- Cook Time: 55 mins

## Ingredients

#### Brown Sugar/Cinnamon Mixture:

- 1/3 cup light brown sugar

- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon

#### Bread Loaf

- 1/2 cup butter softened

- 2/3 cup granulated sugar

- 2 eggs room temp

- 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract

- 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour

- 1 3/4 teaspoons baking powder

- 1/2 cup milk or almond milk room temp

#### Chopped Apple Mixture

- 2 large apples any kind, peeled and chopped small, but not fine. Then toss apples with 2 tablespoons granulated sugar and 1 teaspoon cinnamon just before adding it to the bread mixture.

#### Old-Fashioned Creme Glaze

- 1/2 cup of powdered sugar

- 1-3 tablespoons of milk or cream- depending on thickness of glaze wanted. For more apple fritter style like the apple fritter donut- use more milk for a thinner glaze that you can pour over the whole loaf.

## Method

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Use a 9x5-inch loaf pan and spray with non-stick spray or line with foil and spray with non-stick spray to get out easily for slicing.
---
2. Mix 1/3 cup brown sugar and 1 teaspoon cinnamon together in a bowl. Set aside.
---
3. Combine & whisk 1 & 1/2 cups flour and 1 & 3/4 teaspoons baking powder together in another bowl and set aside.
---
4. In another medium-sized bowl, beat 2/3 cup granulated sugar and 1/2 cup softened butter together using an electric mixer until smooth and creamy.
---
5. Beat in 2 eggs, one at a time until blended in; add in 1 & 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract and mix in.
---
6. Add the flour mixture into creamed butter mixture and mix until blended.
---
7. Mix 1/2 cup milk into batter and continue mixing until smooth.
---
8. Pour half the batter into the prepared loaf pan; add half the chopped apple mixture with the sugar and cinnamon added in.
---
9. Sprinkle 1/2 of the brown sugar/cinnamon mixture you set aside earlier, on top of apple layer.
---
10. Pour the remaining batter over apple layer and top with remaining chopped apples, then the remaining brown sugar/cinnamon mixture.
---
11. Lightly pat apples into batter; swirl brown sugar mixture through apples using knife or spoon.
---
12. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of the loaf comes out clean, approximately 60 minutes.
---
13. To make glaze, mix 1/2 cup powdered sugar and 1 to 3 tablespoons milk or cream together until well mixed.  (Place mixture in microwave for 10 seconds to get it pourable if it needs a boost.)
---
14. Let loaf rest in pan for about 15 minutes before removing from pan to let cool off completely on a cooling rack. Drizzle with glaze.
---
15. If you want more glaze, make a double batch.

## Notes

- Optional:Next time I think I would add in walnuts. You can always use other fruit, or you could add in chocolate chips too! (Of course!)

- Depending on thickness of glaze wanted, you can go for thick or thin. For a more apple fritter style like the apple fritter donut, use 3 tablespoons milk for a thinner glaze that you can pour and drench over the whole loaf and then make another batch again, using 1 tablespoon milk and then drizzle on top of the first glaze.

- Substitutions:

- I've also substituted this with 1/2 cup Greek Yogurt, 1/3 cup milk of choice and add 1/4 teaspoon baking soda instead of 1/2 cup milk as called out in the bread loaf ingredients.

- Vegan: Use flax eggs, earth balance and almond milk.

- Baking options:

- Bake 30-40 min. for 2 loaf recipe (2 8x4 pans)

- 15-20 minutes for muffins

- 50 -60 minutes for one full loaf recipe (9x5 pan)
