## Ingredients

- 3 garlic cloves , minced

- 4 oz sun-dried tomatoes

- 2 tablespoons olive oil

- 1 lb chicken breast tenderloins , sliced

- 1/4 teaspoon salt

- 1/4 teaspoon paprika

- 1 cup half and half (or use 1/2 cup heavy cream + 1/2 cup milk)

- 1 cup mozzarella cheese , shredded (do not use fresh Mozzarella, use pre-shredded Mozzarella)

- 8 oz penne pasta (for gluten free, use gluten free brown rice pasta)

- 1 tablespoon basil

- 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes

- 1/2 cup reserved cooked pasta water or more

- 1/4 teaspoon salt to taste

## Method

1. In a large skillet, saut√© garlic and sun-dried tomatoes (drained from oil) in 2 tablespoons of olive oil (reserved from the sun-dried tomatoes jar) for 1 minute on medium heat until the garlic is fragrant.
---
2. Remove the sun-dried tomatoes from the skillet, leaving the olive oil.
---
3. Add sliced chicken (salted and lightly covered in paprika for color) and cook on high heat for 1 minute on each side. Remove from heat.
---
4. Cook pasta according to package instructions.    Reserve some cooked pasta water. Drain the pasta.
---
5. Slice sun-dried tomatoes into smaller pieces and add them back to the skillet with chicken.
---
6. To make creamy pasta sauce, add half-and-half (see substitution for half-and-half in the Recipe Notes section below) and Mozzarella cheese to the skillet, and bring to a gentle boil.
---
7. Immediately reduce to simmer and cook, constantly stirring, until all cheese melts and creamy sauce forms.
---
8. Add cooked and drained pasta to the skillet with the cream sauce, and stir to combine.
---
9. Add 1 tablespoon of basil, and at least 1/4 teaspoon of red pepper flakes. Stir to combine.
---
10. If the creamy sauce is too thick: Add about 1/2 cup of reserved cooked pasta water to the skillet to thin it out.   Do not add all of pasta water at once - you might need less or more of it.
---
11. Season the chicken pasta with salt and more red pepper flakes, to taste, if needed. Let it simmer for a couple of minutes for flavors to combine.
---
12. Note: Make sure to salt the dish just enough to bring out of the flavors of basil and sun-dried tomatoes.
