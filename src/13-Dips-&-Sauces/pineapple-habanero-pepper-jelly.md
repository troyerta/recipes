## Notes

- See Caf√© tips for more detailed instructions and extra tips. Recipe adapted from Genius Kitchen.

- Makes 48 ounces of jam. The Weck Tulip jars (shown above in the post) are 6-ounce jars so that would make 8 6-ounce jars of jelly.

- If canning with a hot water bath, use regular distilled vinegar instead of rice vinegar.
