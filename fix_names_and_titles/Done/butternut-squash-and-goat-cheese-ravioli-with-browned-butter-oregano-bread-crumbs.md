- Total Time: 1 hr 30 mins

## Ingredients

#### Butternut Squash Ravioli:

- 1 medium butternut squash peeled, seeded + cubed (about 4 cups)

- 1 tablespoon olive

- salt + pepper to taste

- 5 ounces drunken goat cheese or fresh goat cheese crumbled*

- 2 ounces gorgonzola cheese crumbled*

- 1/2 cup freshly grated parmesan

- 1 egg

- 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg

- 1 pound fresh pasta dough

- 12-16 fresh figs sliced

#### Browned Butter Oregano Bread Crumbs:

- 3 cups day old sourdough bread finely torn or pulsed to chunky crumbs in a food processor

- 2 tablespoons olive oil

- 1 tablespoon fresh chopped oregano

- salt + pepper toast

- 6 tablespoons unsalted butter

- 1/2 cup fresh oregano

- 2 ounces prosciutto finely diced

## Method

1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.
---
2. Peel the squash and cut into cubes and placing them on a baking sheet. Coat them with olive oil, salt & pepper. Roast the squash at 400 degrees for 45 minutes until tender. Allow to cool for 15 minutes or so.
---
3. Transfer the squash to a food processor and add the goat cheese, parmesan cheese, egg and nutmeg. Puree until smooth. Taste and season with salt and pepper.
---
4. Roll your pasta dough into lasagna sheets. I like to roll my pasta to the 5th setting, but all pasta machines vary. Heavily flour your ravioli mold or counter. Seriously, do not be afraid of the flour. Flour is your friend and without it your ravioli will stick to the mold (or your counter)!
---
5. Lay one sheet of pasta on the mold, making sure the entire mold is covered. Now, if you have one, grab an egg and fit it into each well. This helps form a space for the filling to go. Remove the egg, now take a tablespoon of the butternut squash filling and place it into each well. Spritz the pasta sheet with a little water or use your fingers and dab some water along all of the ravioli edges. Lay the second sheet on top and run a rolling pin over to seal. Turn the mold over to release the ravioli. They will not be fully separated. Use a pizza cutter or sharp knife to cut them fully apart. Lay the ravioli on a parchment lined baking sheet and continue making ravioli until you've used all the cheese filling. Make sure to cover the ravioli with a damp towel as you work. At this point you can freeze the ravioli for later if desired, or continue on with the recipe.

#### Browned Butter Oregano Bread Crumbs:

1. Heat a large skillet over medium heat and add the olive oil. Once hot, add the bread crumbs, oregano, salt + pepper and cook, stirring for 4-5 minutes or until toasted and golden. Remove the bread crumbs from the pan to a plate.
---
2. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
---
3. Place the butter, remaining 1/2 cup oregano leaves and prosciutto in the skillet and cook over medium heat until the butter is browned and the prosciutto crisp. Remove from the heat.
---
4. Boil the ravioli for 1-2 minutes or until they float. Carefully remove the ravioli from the water and gently stir the ravioli into the butter sauce. Divide the ravioli among plates and top with the breadcrumbs and figs. Serve immediately with goat cheese.
