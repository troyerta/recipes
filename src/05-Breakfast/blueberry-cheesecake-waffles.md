# Blueberry Cheesecake Waffles

## Overview

- Yield:
- Total Time: 5-10 mins

## Ingredients

- 1 to 2 Cups Pancake mix (Start with 1 1/2 and add until you get the desired consistency).

- 3/4 Cup Water

- 1/3 Cup Vegetable Oil

- 2 Eggs

- 1 Can sweetened and condensed milk -Eagle brand! (very important) as I have tried a store brand and it was too runny. If you only have a store brand you can use it, you will just need to add about 3-4 oz of additional cream cheese to get the right consistency.

- 1 - 8 oz package cream cheese

- Juice of one large lemon (or 2 medium-small lemons) or 1 1/4 Tablespoon

- 1/3 can Blueberry pie filling

- Pam/cooking spray

- Waffle Iron

## Method

1. Start waffle iron
---
2. Blend the pancake mix, water, eggs, and oil in the blender on a low mix setting for about 30 seconds or until just mixed. Do not over mix. Add more pancake mix if the mixture is too runny. It should be the consistency of drinkable yogurt. Once the iron is preheated, pour the mixture in (spraying with Pam first).
---
3. While the waffles are cooking heat the unwrapped cream cheese for 30 seconds in the microwave, juice the lemon, and open the sweetened condensed milk. Mix all 3 ingredients together in a medium sized bowl with a hand mixer or like.
---
4. When the waffles are done, top with cheesecake topping and add blueberries on top. For those who like rich and sweet add more topping, for those who do not like rich things spread both toppings very thin.
