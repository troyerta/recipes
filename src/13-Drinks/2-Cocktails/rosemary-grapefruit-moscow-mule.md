2. Fill a Collins glass or copper mug with crushed ice and double strain the grapefruit mixture into the glass/mug. Top with ginger beer and adjust sweetness to taste by adding more simple if desired. Garnish with a lime slice and rosemary sprig.

## Notes

- you can get about 1/2 C of juice out of one medium grapefruit. That'll give you enough juice for about two and a half drinks.

-
The cocktail can be made up to one day in advance without adding the ginger beer, stored in a lidded container. When ready to share, pour into Collins glass or mug and then top with ginger beer.
