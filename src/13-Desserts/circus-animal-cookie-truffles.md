# Circus Animal Cookie Truffles

## Overview

- Yield: 18 servings
- Prep Time: 45 mins
- Cook Time: 3 mins
- Total Time: 48 mins

## Ingredients

- 1 bag Frosted Animal Crackers Cookies

- 4 ounces Cream Cheese

- Pink Candy Melts

- White Candy Melts, (or White Chocolate Almond Bark)

- Rainbow Sprinkles, (also called Nonpareils)

## Method

1. Add animal cracker cookies to food processor or plastic bag and crush until finely ground.
---
2. Pour the cookie crumbs into a bowl and add cream cheese. Mix until thoroughly combined. You can use a spoon, although I find it works better (and is more fun) to use your hands!
---
3. Next, roll the mixture into about 1-inch size balls and place onto a cookie sheet lined with wax paper. Repeat until the cookie mixture is all used up.
---
4. Place the cookie sheet in the refrigerator or freezer until truffle balls are chilled and firm - between 15-30 minutes will do the trick.
---
5. Just before removing the balls from the freezer, get started on preparing your candy melts. Using separate bowls for white and pink, follow the melting instructions on the package of your candy melts.
---
6. Carefully dip the truffles in your melted candies until fully covered. I find it works best to use 2 forks to roll the truffles and lift from the melted candy while gently shaking off the excess.
---
7. Place the coated truffles back on your cookie sheet and quickly top with sprinkles before the coating hardens.
