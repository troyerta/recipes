# Chocolate Truffles

## Overview

- Yield: 24 truffles

## Ingredients

- 10 oz dark chocolate melts (chocolate chips, or chocolate block coarsely chopped)

- 2 tbsp (30g) unsalted butter

- 1/2 cup (125ml) cream (full fat, not low fat, not whipped)

## Method

1. Place chocolate, cream and butter in a microwave proof bowl. Microwave on high for 4 x 30 second bursts, stirring in between.
---
2. Cover bowl with a plate and stand for 5 minutes, then stir until chocolate is melted and smooth (this is a ganache!)
---
3. Place the bowl in the refrigerator for 6 hours. Do not be tempted to shortcut it by freezing it! (Note 2)
---
4. Put a dinner plate or tray that you will use to place the rolled truffles on in the fridge as well.

### Rolling the truffles

1. Place cocoa / coatings of choice in a small bowl or plate.
---
2. Remove Ganache from fridge. The chocolate mixture should be firm - softer than cold butter but harder than peanut butter.
---
3. Get an ice pack or bag of frozen peas from the freezer and place on the bench. Cover with a couple of paper towels. ("Freezer Pack").
---
4. Scoop up a tablespoon (using tablespoon measure), then use a teaspoon to scoop the mixture out into your hands (see video). Roll into ball then place on chilled plate. Repeat with remaining chocolate mixture, chilling hands on Freezer Pack as needed.
---
5. Once all balls are rolled, roll in cocoa or Coatings of choice. Serve at room temp so the chocolate is beautifully creamy inside!

## Notes

- Chocolate - even using everyday dark chocolate will make luxurious chocolate truffles. But if you do indulge in expensive chocolate, it makes it even more amazing! Note: you must use COOKING chocolate here, ie the chocolate sold in the baking aisle of grocery stores. Eating chocolate doesn't melt properly / smoothly and may not set to the right consistency. Cooking chocolate is intended for the purpose of melting and using in recipes.

- Ganache consistency - it needs to be firm enough to roll into balls, but soft enough to scoop. If you leave it overnight (as I often do), just leave it out for 30 minutes or so to soften to scoop able.

- Rolling tips: can get messy, so follow my tips! The chocolate is supposed to be creamy and soft at room temperature, so it softens quickly once you start handling it. (1) Cold plate or tray for placing the balls on. (2) Keep your hands COLD. I have hot little hands. I keep a bag of frozen peas or ice pack handy to chill my hands!

- Coating suggestions: coconut shavings, cocoa powder (this is the classic coating), icing (confectioners) sugar, caster sugar, crushed nuts, sprinkles or other decorating bits, crushed candy cane, chocolate shavings.

- Flavouring suggestions: any liquor, orange, peppermint, coffee, coconut, almond essence.

- Storing and serving - weeks and weeks in the fridge! Or even out of the fridge if it's not too warm where you are. MUST serve at room temp so the chocolate is so creamy and melts in your mouth when you bite into it - JUST like those expensive truffles that cost a fortune to buy from gourmet stores!
