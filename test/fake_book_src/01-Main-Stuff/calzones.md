## Method

1. Make pizza dough in accordance with store bought packaging instructions, or use another recipe because Lord knows this one didn't come with directions...
---
2. Flour a countertop and place the prepared pizza dough on top of it. Divide the dough into four sections.
---
3. Take one of the sections and roll it out to 6 - 8 inches in diameter.
---
4. Top with your desired ingredients, leaving plenty of room around the edges.
---
5. Fold the dough in half around the stuffing and seal the two edges together using a wet fingertip.
---
6. further seal the edges by wrapping the edge in on itself, creating a pie-like ripple texture all the way around (you know, like calzones have)
---
7. Repeat steps 3 - 6 for the other three dough sections.
---
8. Transfer the calzones to a prepared baking sheet. Cut 3 small slits along the top of each pocket for ventilation, and brush olive oil on each pocket and sprinkle with coarse salt.
---
9. Bake at 500 deg F for 20 minutes.
