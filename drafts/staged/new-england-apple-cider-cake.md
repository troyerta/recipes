#### For the Cake:

- 1 cup apple cider

- 2 cups Granny Smith apples ( 3 large or 4 small apples)

- 1 whole lemon

- ¼ cup softened butter ( 4 tablespoons or half a stick)

- 1 cup granulated sugar

- 2 eggs

- 2 cups flour

#### For the Glaze:

## Method

1. Place the first cup of apple cider on the stove and bring to a boil and boil until reduced to ¼ cup. Set aside to cool.
---

2. Core and peel the apples and then cut each into 16 slices (fewer slices if using smaller apples). Have a bowl of water that has a whole lemon squeezed into it. Place apples into water and then onto a plate to dry and set aside. This will keep them from turning brown.
---

3. Preheat oven to 350 degrees
---

4. In the bowl of a stand mixer with paddle attachment, beat butter and sugar until well mixed.
---

5. With the mixer running, add one egg at a time beating until smooth. Scrap sides and beat until light and fluffy, about three minutes.
---

6. In a medium bowl, sift flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt.
---

7. Measure out cream and add cooled reduced cider to cream.
---

8. With the mixer on low, alternate adding the flour mixture and the cream/cider mixture until well combined. Scrape sides and mix until smooth.
---

9. Grease a 9X9 square pan liberally with vegetable shortening and pour in the batter.
---

10. Arrange the apples, outer edges up into the top of the batter.
---

11. In a small bowl or cup, mix the sugar with cinnamon and sprinkle over the top of the cake and place in the oven for 50-60 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into center comes out clean.
---

12. While the cake is baking, make the glaze.
---

13. Place the second cup of apple cider on the stove as before only reduce down to two tablespoons. Watch it that it doesn’t evaporate too far.
---

14. Place the confectioners’ sugar in a small bowl and add the reduced cider along with one tablespoon of milk or cream and stir. Add the last tablespoon of milk or cream a little at a time until desired consistency. It should be thick but runny enough to drizzle off the end of a spoon.
---

15. When the cake comes out of the oven, cool to room temperature and cut into nine squares.
---

16. Drizzle the glaze over each portion letting it run down the sides and serve.
---

17. Serve with vanilla ice cream if desired.
