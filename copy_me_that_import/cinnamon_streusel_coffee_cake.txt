INGREDIENTS

Cake:

1 cup nondairy milk + 1 tbs apple cider vinegar
2 cups all purpose flour
3/4 cup sugar
1 tsp baking soda
1 tsp baking powder
1 tsp salt
1/2 cup vegan sour cream
1/2 cup canola oil
1/2 tbsp vanilla extract

Cinnamon Streusel Topping:

1/2 cup flour
1 cup brown sugar
1 tbsp cinnamon
1/4 cup vegan butter cold

Drizzle:

3/4 cup powdered sugar
2-3 tsp nondairy milk more or less depending on consistency

STEPS

1) Preheat the oven to 350°F.

Make the cake:

1) Whisk together the milk and vinegar. Set aside to curdle.

2) In a mixing bowl, whisk the flour, sugar, baking powder and soda, and salt.

3) Add the sour cream, oil, vanilla, and milk mixture to the flour mixture. Beat until combined.

Make the topping:

1) In a separate bowl, add the ingredients for the topping and use a fork to combine everything together.

Assemble the cake:

1) Grease a 9×12 cake pan. Spread ~half of the batter around the bottom of the pan. Sprinkle ~1/2 of the topping

2) Spread the remaining batter and sprinkle the rest of the topping.

3) Bake for 25-35 minutes, until a toothpick comes out clean or with only crumbs.

4) Whisk together the ingredients for the drizzle.

5) Once the cake cools (it can still be a bit warm – it’s delish warm or room temp), drizzle the powdered sugar mixture over the cake, cut, and serve!
