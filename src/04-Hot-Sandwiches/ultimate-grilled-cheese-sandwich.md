5. To assemble, spread one side of each piece of bread with the spicy mayo. Build the sandwich however you wish: eggs, bacon, cheese, onions, more eggs, more cheese. Spread one side of the assembled sandwich with softened butter and put it butter-side down on a griddle or skillet over medium-low heat. Spread the top side with butter, then continue grilling the sandwich until the bread is golden and slightly crisp and the filling is warm/cheese is melted.

6. Cut in half with a sharp serrated knife and share with a loved one!
