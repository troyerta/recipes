# Fudgy Homemade Brownies

## Overview

- Yield: 18
- Prep Time: 20 mins
- Cook Time: 30 mins
- Total Time: 50 mins

## Ingredients

- 3 sticks unsalted butter ( 1.5 cups)

- 12 ounces semisweet chocolate chips, divided

- 2 tablespoons vegetable or canola oil

- 2 cups granulated sugar

- 1/2 cup light brown sugar, lightly packed

- 6 large eggs

- 1 tablespoon vanilla extract

- 1 teaspoon instant coffee granules

- 1 cup all-purpose flour

- 1 cup Dutch processed cocoa powder

- 2 teaspoons cornstarch

- 1 1/2 teaspoons salt

## Method

1. Line an 8×12″ aluminum or nonstick baking dish with parchment paper*. Preheat the oven to 350°F.

2. Add the butter and half of the semisweet chocolate chips to a large, microwave-safe bowl. Save remaining chocolate for later.
---

3. Microwave in 20 second intervals until the chocolate is fully melted and combined, stirring in-between. Add the sugars and oil to the chocolate mixture and stir until well combined and the sugars have mostly dissolved. Allow to cool until just slightly warm to the touch.
---

4. Add in the eggs, vanilla extract, and instant coffee granules. Whip until thick and fluffy.
---

5. Sift in the flour, cocoa powder, cornstarch, and salt, and mix. Continue to fold in using a flexible baking spatula.
---

6. Once well-combined, fold in the remaining chocolate chips. Transfer to the prepared baking dish.
---

7. Bake until brownies are glossy on top but soft and not fully set, about 35 minutes*. Allow the pan to cool fully before transferring and slicing so the brownies firm up and set.

## Notes

- Keep in mind that if you use a glass baking dish, as this will change baking times. It takes significantly longer for glass to heat up, so test accordingly. I recommend using metal for aluminum or nonstick for best results.

- Test the brownies with a skewer if you’re unsure of their doneness– the skewer WILL NOT come out clean, it should be fudgy, but not overly wet. You may need to return to the oven for extra time depending on your oven.

- Use melted chocolate. Duh, this one is obvious, but a lot of recipes skip it. As I mentioned above, I use melted chocolate chips in order to encourage the shiny top. I also incorporate additional chocolate chips throughout the brownie batter at the end so they’re studded throughout the brownies for extra chocolate flavor.

- Use dutch processed cocoa powder. If you’ve ever sunk your teeth into a super dark, almost black baked good and rolled your eyes back at how delicious it tasted, it’s probably because you were eating a cake or brownie or cookie that used dutch processed cocoa powder. Dutch processed cocoa is a smoother, less acidic cocoa powder with more earthy flavors and a signature dark color, but I moreso tend to use it because it almost always involves the use of higher quality cocoa beans in production. Higher quality cocoa beans = tastier cocoa powder = tastier brownies.

- Use instant coffee granules. I know, this one sounds weird, but coffee is one of those ingredients that brings out flavor of chocolate immensely and adds fantastic depth without becoming distracting– or at least it does when added in the proper proportions. 1 teaspoon to a tablespoon on instant coffee granules is the perfect range here for deeper chocolatiness without any discernible coffee flavor. Yes, you can leave it out if you’d like, but it really does add a great boost!

- Use salt.  Like with coffee, you’re not TASTING the salt, it’s just bringing out the flavors of chocolate and sugar here. Generally speaking, salt intensifies the body’s ability to taste other existing flavors (including sweetness). For this reason, salt is always used in baked goods. I use a teaspoon and a half of kosher salt in the brownies here (you’ll need a bit less if using table salt– a teaspoon will do) and you can even use some flaky sea salt on top if you’d like to get extra fancy.

- Use vanilla. Last one. Most people think of chocolate and vanilla being opposites, but vanilla extract will actually enhance the flavor of chocolate, so don’t skimp on it!
