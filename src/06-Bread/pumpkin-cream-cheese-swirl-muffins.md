## Ingredients

- 1 (15 oz) can pumpkin (pure pumpkin puree)

- 1 cup granulated sugar

- 1/2 cup packed brown sugar

- 1 tablespoon vanilla extract

#### Cream Cheese Swirl:

2. In a medium bowl, whisk flour, pumpkin spice, baking soda and salt until well combined. Set aside.

3. In large bowl, whisk together pumpkin, sugar and brown sugar.

4. Beat in eggs, vegetable oil and vanilla extract. Slowly whisk in the flour mixture, until there are no lumps. Fill muffin tins 3/4 full.

5. In a medium bowl, beat cream cheese until smooth. Add in sugar, egg yolk and vanilla extract and beat until well combined.

6. Top each muffin with about 1 tablespoon of cream cheese mixture and use a toothpick to swirl it into the batter. This will not look smooth, but it will bake up much prettier. (You can see exactly how I did this in the video above.)

7. Bake muffins for 18-20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.
