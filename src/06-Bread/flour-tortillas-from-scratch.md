# Flour Tortillas From Scratch

## Overview

- Yield: 16 tortillas
- Prep Time: 30 mins
- Cook Time: 30 mins
- Total Time: 1 hr 15 mins

## Ingredients

- 3 cups all-purpose flour

- 1 teaspoon salt

- 1 teaspoon baking powder

- 1/3 cup vegetable oil, shortening, or lard

- 1 cup hot water

## Method

#### Stand Mixer Instructions:

1. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook, combine flour, salt, and baking powder. Mix briefly to combine.
---
2. With the mixer running at medium speed, add oil and water. Mix for 1-2 minutes, stopping at least once to scrape the sides of the bowl. After the dough begins to come together into a ball, reduce mixer speed to low and continue mixing for 1-2 minutes, until dough is smooth.

#### Mix by Hand Instructions:

1. In a large mixing bowl, combine flour, salt, and baking powder. Whisk briefly to combine, then add vegetable oil. Stir until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
---
2. Pour in warm water and stir to combine. Knead briefly with well-floured hands until the mixture comes together into a craggy dough.

#### Either way, to proceed..

3. Whether you used a stand mixer or your hands, transfer dough at this point from the mixing bowl to a well-floured work surface. Divide into 16 roughly equal portions. Roll each portion into a ball and flatten slightly with the palm of your hand. Cover flattened balls of dough with a clean kitchen towel, and allow to rest for at least 15 minutes and up to an hour.

4. When ready to cook, warm a large cast-iron or heavy-bottomed skillet over medium-high heat.
---
5. Keeping the work surface and rolling pin lightly floured, roll each dough ball into a circle about 6‚Äù in diameter. (Try not to stack the rolled tortillas on top of one another - this makes it more difficult to transfer them to the pan. If you need additional staging area, a lightly floured sheet of parchment paper works well.)
---
6. Transfer tortillas one at a time into the hot skillet. Cook for about 1 minute, until small bubbles form on the top and brown spots form on the bottom surface. (If it takes much longer than a minute to see golden brown spots on the underside, increase the heat slightly. If instead the tortilla browns too much or too quickly, reduce the heat.) Flip and cook the other side for about 30 seconds.
---
7. Remove from the pan and stack cooked tortillas loosely wrapped in a clean kitchen towel. (This will keep them soft, pliable, and warm.)
---
8. Serve immediately or allow to cool for later use. Tortillas can be stored for 2-3 days in the fridge in a plastic zip-top bag; before using, wrap tortillas in slightly damp paper towel and microwave for 15-30 seconds. Tortillas can also be frozen for 2-3 months; to freeze, separate tortillas with sheets of parchment or waxed paper and store in a zip-top freezer bag.
