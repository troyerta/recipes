## Ingredients

#### the Quinoa:

- 1 cup quinoa

- 1 & ¼ cups water

- ¼ teaspoon salt

#### the Veggies:

- about 1 pound of butternut squash, cut into 1 & ½ inch cubes

- 14 ounces of fresh Brussels sprouts, trimmed and cut in half, from top to bottom

- 1 large, or up to 4 small red onions, peeled and cut into chunks about the same size as the squash.

- A few sprigs of fresh thyme, or ½ teaspoon dried thyme, sprinkled over the veggies

- olive oil

- kosher salt & fresh ground black pepper

#### the Vinaigrette:

- Juice of 1 lemon

- 1 minced clove of garlic

- 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard

- pinch of sugar

- ½ teaspoon kosher salt

- 7-8 grinds black pepper

- ⅓ cup of good quality olive oil

## Method

#### Cook the Quinoa:

1. Rinse the quinoa well, and drain in a fine mesh strainer.
---

2. Using a medium saucepan, combine the rinsed quinoa with the water and salt.
---

3. Bring to a simmer and cook, with the lid left open a crack, for about 15 minutes, until most of the water is absorbed - it may take a little longer, so just give it a few more minutes if you need to.
---

4. When the quinoa is done, leave the lid on and set aside.
---

#### Roast the Veggies:

1. While the quinoa is cooking, place all of the vegetables on a large baking sheet, and drizzle generously with olive oil. Stir around to get it all evenly coated, and sprinkle with the salt and pepper. Break the thyme stems into smaller pieces, and scatter among the vegetables.
---

2. Roast in a 400º oven for about 30 minutes, stirring a couple times, until everything is cooked nicely, and can be pierced with the tip of a pairing knife fairly easily.
---

#### Make the Vinaigrette:

1. In a small bowl, whisk the lemon juice with the garlic, mustard, sugar, salt and pepper, until the salt and sugar are dissolved.
---

2. Whisk in the oil, in a thin stream to combine and emulsify the vinaigrette
---

#### Assemble the Dish:

1. When the veggies are tender and cooked through, take a nice serving bowl and layer the cooked quinoa in the bottom. Put about half of the veggies on top, making sure to remove the stems from the thyme, and gently combine the veg and and quinoa. Kind of mound it in the center a bit, and then scatter the remaining vegetables over the top. Drizzle with a couple tablespoons of the vinaigrette.
---

2. Serve warm, and store leftovers in the fridge.
---

3. I put the additional vinaigrette on the table to be added to taste. This would also be good with a balsamic or raspberry vinaigrette I think – you can experiment to see what you like the best. I am also thinking that some crumbles of feta cheese would not go amiss in there either – I’ll be trying that next time. For now though, I think we can get by on this version.
