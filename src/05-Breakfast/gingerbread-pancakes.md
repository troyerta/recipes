# Gingerbread Pancakes

## Overview

- Yield: 10-12 pancakes

- Prep Time: 15 min

- Cook Time: 10 min

## Ingredients

- 1½ cups old-fashioned oats or oat flour

- 3/4 cup all purpose flour (or 1 for 1 gluten free flour)

- 2 teaspoons baking powder

- 2 teaspoons ground ginger

- 1 teaspoons cinnamon

- 1 teaspoon ground allspice

- ½ teaspoon kosher salt

- 2 eggs

- 2 tablespoons pure maple syrup, plus more for serving

- 2 tablespoons molasses

- 1 cup milk

- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil

## Method

### Sub-method 1 (sub-methods are optional)

1. If making homemade oat flour: place the oats in a high speed blender or food processor and blend until finely ground. If using oat flour, skip this step and just use 1 1/2 cups oat flour.

2. In a medium bowl, combine the oat flour, all purpose flour (or gluten free flour), baking powder, ginger, cinnamon, allspice, and kosher salt.
---
3. In another medium bowl, whisk together the eggs, then whisk in the maple syrup, molasses, milk and vegetable oil. Pour in the dry ingredients and mix until a batter forms. Allow the batter to sit for 3 minutes, which will allow it to thicken.
---
4. Lightly grease a skillet with butter and wipe off any extra grease with a paper towel. Heat the skillet to medium heat.
---
5. Add a splash of milk to the batter so that it comes to a pour-able consistency. Pour the batter into small circles and fry the pancakes until the bubbles pop on the top. Then flip and heat until cooked through and lightly browned. For each subsequent batch, add a splash of milk before pouring onto the griddle until the consistency is pourable and not too thick (the oats continue to soak up moisture, so this is the most reliable method for oatmeal pancakes).

6. Serve immediately with a drizzle of pure maple syrup. The pancakes will taste lightly sweet without syrup, but adding syrup really brings out the gingerbread flavor!

## Notes

#### Tips on cooking:

- Add a splash of milk before cooking each batch. The batter for these pancakes is thick because the oats soak up more of the liquid than an all-flour pancake would. Before you cook each batch on the griddle, add a splash of milk to get it to a pourable consistency.

- Top with a little maple syrup. Top these pancakes a bit of pure maple syrup, and they taste like gingerbread dough! Using a hint of maple really helps to bring out the flavors.
