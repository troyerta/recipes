## Method

1. Heat 1 tablespoon of coconut oil in a saucepan. While the oil heats up, peel and slice the onion then add it to the saucepan and fry for 8 minutes. Meanwhile peel and slice the garlic, ginger and chilli (leave the seeds in if you like it hot) then add them to the saucepan and fry for 2 minutes.

2. Dice the potatoes and add them to the pan. Fry for 10 minutes. Next add the curry paste and fry for 1 minute (note:  if you’re unsure of how hot your curry paste is, try adding 2 tbsp of the paste to start with, then while it’s simmering later, taste the soup and add more to your liking). Then add the coconut milk, peanut butter and stock, along with 200ml (6.7 fl.oz) of hot water from a kettle. Bring the soup to boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 15 minutes or until the potato is soft.

3. Remove the soup from the heat and squeeze in the juice of half a lime, add a handful of coriander and season to taste with salt and pepper. Blend the soup using a handheld blender or transfer to a high-speed blender and blend until smooth.

4. Divide the soup between the serving bowls and finish with a swirl of vegan single cream. Slice the remaining lime half and use the slices to decorate the soup. Roughly chop a handful of peanuts and a few coriander leaves, then sprinkle both over the soups along with some chilli flakes. And finito!
