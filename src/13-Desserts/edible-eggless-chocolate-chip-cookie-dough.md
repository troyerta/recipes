# Edible Eggless Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough

## Ingredients

- 1 stick unsalted butter, softened

- 3/4 cups packed brown sugar

- 2 teaspoons vanilla (based upon feedback, you may want to reduce this amount. I like a prominent vanilla flavor but feel free to adjust)

- 1/2 teaspoon salt

- 1 cup all-purpose flour

- 2 tablespoons milk

- 1/2 cup mini chocolate chips

- 1/2 cup milk chocolate chips

## Method

1. With your mixer, cream together butter and brown sugar. Add in vanilla and salt, mix.
---
2. Add in flour. The mixture is going to be crumbly at this point.
---
3. Add in 2 tablespoons of milk and mix. Now the dough will look like the cookie dough youâ€™re used to seeing.
---
4. Fold in 1/2 cup mini chocolate chips and 1/2 cup milk chocolate chips.
---
5. Store leftovers in the refrigerator. Freeze for up to three months.
---
6. WARNING: There is a small risk of illness from eating raw flour.
