## Method

1. First peel the butternut squash and dice it into small cubes, then leave to one side for later.
---

2. Add a generous tbsp of Flora Buttery to a large saucepan on a medium heat.
---

3. Peel and finely dice the red onion, then transfer to the saucepan. Fry for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.
---

4. Meanwhile, peel and dice the ginger and garlic, then add it to the saucepan and fry for 2 minutes, stirring occasionally.
---

5. Dice the red chillies and discard the seeds (we prefer to give this curry a more subtle heat, but you can leave the seeds in if you like it spicy). Add the ground cumin, mustard seeds, ground coriander, garam masala and the diced chilies to the saucepan. Give everything a good stir, then leave to fry for 2 minutes, stirring occasionally.
---

6. Next add the tinned tomatoes, coconut milk, tomato puree, peanut butter, soy sauce, a pinch of salt and the cubed butternut squash to the saucepan. Give everything a good stir, then leave to simmer with the lid on for 20 minutes or until the squash is almost cooked, but still has a bite to it. Give the curry a stir every so often to prevent it sticking to the bottom.
---

7. Cook the rice according to the packet instructions.
---

8. Peel and thinly slice the remaining red onion, transfer to a bowl and add the apple cider vinegar. Use your hands to mix the onion and vinegar together, then leave to pickle while you complete the remaining steps.
---

9. Meanwhile, roughly chop the peanuts, fresh coriander (removing any large stalks) and slice the lime into wedges. Leave them all to one side for later.
---

10. Drain and rinse the chickpeas, and trim the ends off the green beans. Add both to the saucepan, give everything a stir and leave to simmer for 5 minutes with the lid off.
---

11. When the beans and squash are both cooked (the beans should still be crunchy), squeeze in the juice from the lime, give everything a final stir and season to taste with any extra salt.
---

12. Serve the curry with the rice and top with the pickled red onion, peanuts and coriander, along with a wedge of lime.
