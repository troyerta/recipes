## Overview

- Yield: 1 loaf
- Prep Time: 30 mins
- Cook Time: 1 hour
- Total Time: 1 hr 30 mins

## Ingredients

- ½ cup walnuts

- 3 to 4 very ripe bananas (enough for 1 cup total)

- 1/2 cup unsalted butter

- 3/4 cup brown sugar

- 1 large egg

- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

- 1 teaspoon baking soda

- 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt

- 1 cup all-purpose flour

- 1/2 cup Dutch-process cocoa powder


## Method

1. Preheat oven to 350°F. Butter a 9×5-inch loaf pan.

2. Chop the walnuts.

3. Mash the bananas in the bottom of a large bowl, enough for 1 cup. Melt the butter, then whisk it into the bananas along with the brown sugar, egg, and vanilla extract.
---
4. Add the baking soda, kosher salt, all-purpose flour, and Dutch-process cocoa powder to the bowl and stir together with a spoon.

5. Pour the batter into the loaf pan and top with chopped walnuts.

6. Bake 55 to 65 minutes (insert a toothpick into the center of the loaf: if it comes out clean, it’s done!) Cool in the pan for 15 minutes. Then run a knife around the edge and invert the loaf onto a cooling rack. Serve warm or at room temperature. The bread keeps up to 4 days at room temperature wrapped in aluminum foil.
