# Hawaiian Chicken Skewers

## Overview

- Yield: 4

## Ingredients

- ¼ cup low sodium soy sauce

- 2 oz canned pineapple juice

- ¼ cup light coconut milk

- 2 tablespoons honey

- 2 garlic cloves, minced (I used the  Pampered Chef Garlic Smash & Paste to mince the garlic and it was super easy)

- 1 tablespoon grated ginger (I used the  Pampered Chef Ginger Grater to grate the ginger and it worked awesome)

- ½ teaspoon sesame oil

- 2 scallions, chopped

- 1 lb fresh pineapple, cut into bite-sized pieces (I used  Pampered Chef Fruit & Cheese Cutter to cut them into fun Hawaiian flowers!)

- 1 ½ pounds (24 oz) raw boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into bite sized chunks

- You’ll also need 12” skewers – if using wooden skewers you should soak them in water for about 30 minutes before use

## Method

1. To create the marinade, combine the soy sauce, pineapple juice, coconut milk, honey, garlic, ginger, sesame oil, and scallions and mix thoroughly. Pour marinade into a gallon Ziploc bag and add chicken. Seal bag and shake to coat chicken in the marinade. Place the bag in the refrigerator so that the chicken is covered in the marinade and refrigerate for at least 4 hours (but can marinate longer – I let it marinate overnight and the chicken was super flavorful).

2. Pre-heat the grill until hot. Divide the chicken and pineapple evenly onto the eight skewers. Place the skewers directly on the grill or a skewer rack over the grill over low heat. We made some using the Pampered Chef  BBQ Corn & Skewer Rack and some directly on the grill. Both worked well – it just depends on whether you prefer char marks or not! Depending on your grill, cooking times may vary. On our 4-burner grill the chicken skewers cooked in about 10 minutes, so I suggest cooking yours for about 5-6 minutes and then flipping them and continuing to cook until chicken is cooked through.
