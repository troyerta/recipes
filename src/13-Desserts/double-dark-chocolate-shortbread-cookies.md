# Double Dark Chocolate Shortbread Cookies

## Overview

- Yield: 18 cookies
- Prep Time: 15 mins
- Cook Time: 12 mins

## Ingredients

- 1 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature (this is important)

- 1/2 cup confectioner's sugar sifted

- 1/2 cup dark cocoa powder, sifted (I use Hershey's Special Dark)

- 2 teaspoons vanilla

- 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour

- 1 cup dark chocolate chips

## Method

1. Cream the butter, cocoa powder and sugar together until completely combined and smooth. Add in the vanilla. if using a stand mixer, be sure to scrape down the sides of the bowl.

2. Mix in the flour, making sure to get it thoroughly blended, but don't over mix.
---
3. Fold in the chocolate chips and turn the dough out onto a board dusted with cocoa powder. The dough will be sticky.
---
4. For roll and cut cookies, form into an 8 inch disk (like you would do for pie dough.) Wrap in plastic and refrigerate for at least 3 hours or until firm enough to roll out. You can also freeze the dough for later use.
---
5. Preheat oven to 325F
---
6. Roll the disk out to 1/3 inch thickness and cut cookies with a 2 1/2 inch round cookie cutter. Use cocoa powder liberally to prevent sticking to the surface and to your rolling pin. Place the cookies on a parchment lined baking sheet and bake for 12-15 minutes. The cookies will still be soft, but will firm up as they cool. Cool them on the baking sheet for 10 minutes, then carefully transfer them to a cooling rack.
---
7. For slice and bake cookies, form a 10" log. Wrap in plastic wrap, smoothing the dough as you wrap it, and twist the ends to secure. Refrigerate for at least 3 hours until firm enough to slice. You can also freeze the dough for later use.
---
8. Slice the log into 1/3" slices with a sharp knife. If some of the chips fall out of place, or the dough crumbles as you slice, reform it with your hands. Place the cookies on a parchment lined baking sheet and bake for 12-15 minutes. The cookies will still be soft, but will firm up as they cool. Cool them on the baking sheet for 10 minutes, then carefully transfer them to a cooling rack.
