## Notes

- Salsa keeps fresh in the refrigerator for 3 to 4 days.

- MILD SALSA: remove the veins and seeds from the jalapeno

- UTTERLY MILD SALSA: use 2 tablespoons green chiles

- MEDIUM SALSA: Prepare as written

- HOT SALSA: Use 2 jalapenos, veins and seeds included

- The canned diced jalapenos are packed with citric acid NOT vinegar. Add about 2 tablespoons (canned jalapenos) per 1 fresh jalapeno with seeds and veins (called for in the recipe) . If you want medium-mild, start with 1 tablespoon.
