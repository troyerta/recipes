# Elderflower Champagne Cocktail

## Overview

- Yield: 8

- Prep Time: 5 mins

- Total Time: 5 mins

## Ingredients

- 1 (750-ml) bottle Brut champagne or dry sparkling wine, chilled

- 1 cup of elderflower liqueur, like St. Germain

- 1 (12-ounce) can of club soda or seltzer water, chilled

- 1 cup sliced strawberries


## Method

1. In a large pitcher, combine all of the ingredients and stir. Add ice. Pour into glasses filled with ice and scoop a few strawberries into each glass.

## Notes

- The recipe can be made without the club soda, but cut the elderflower liqueur by 1/4 cup.

- The strawberries can be removed completely or you can substitute other fresh berries, sliced peaches, or other fresh fruit.

- To make just one cocktail, combine 1 ounce of elderflower liqueur and 3 ounces of chilled Champagne with a few sliced strawberries.
