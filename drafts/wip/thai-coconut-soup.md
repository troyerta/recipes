## Method

1. Heat oil in a large saucepan over high heat. Add prawns and sear both sides until light golden (doesn't need to cook inside). Remove onto plate.

2. Turn heat down to medium. If pot is looking dry, add a touch of extra oil.

3. Add garlic, ginger and lemongrass. Saute for 20 seconds until garlic is golden.
---
4. Add sugar and fish sauce. Stir and cook for 30 seconds - it should look like caramel.

---
7. Simmer for 2 minutes, then add lime zest and return prawns into broth.

8. Cook for 2 minutes just to reheat and finish cooking the prawns.

## Serve

Place noodles in bowl. Ladle over soup.

Top with bean sprouts and coriander, plus toppings of choice (chilli, red onion, Asian fried shallots)

Squeeze over lime juice to taste

## Notes

1. Prawns - defrost if using frozen.

2. Lemongrass - peel reedy outer layers and just use the bottom 12cm/5" of the stalk, the part that's white and very pale green that can be grated.
Lemongrass paste can be used instead - stir in 1 tbsp once the coconut milk is added.

3. Curry Powder - any is fine here - Madras, Clives of India, mild, spicy, whatever

4. Chilli Paste - Any chilli paste is fine here. Even sriracha or other Asiany hot sauce. This is to add spiciness and adds colour to the sauce. I like using Chilli Garlic Paste, samba oelak or Chinese Chilli Paste.

5. Low fat coconut milk can be used but the sauce won't have as good a coconut flavour and will be a bit thinner.

6. Noodles - use 200g/7oz of fresh thick noodles or about 180g/6oz of thinner fresh noodles. Or 120 - 150g/4 - 5 oz dried noodles (any type - rice, vermicelli, egg noodles, ramen)

7. Asian fried shallots - an essential garnish in Asian cooking! Slices of shallots deep fried until crispy then seasoned with salt. Terrific for texture and flavour, used regularly as a garnish in Asian cooking. Found in Asian stores and in the Asian aisle of supermarkets (Coles, Woolies in Australia)
