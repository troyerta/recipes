# Pimento Cheese Grits

## Overview

- Yield: 4
- Total Time: 1 Hr

## Ingredients

#### Pimento Cheese

- 12 ounces sharp white cheddar cheese freshly grated

- 1 4-ounce jar of pimentos, drained

- 4 ounces 1/2 block cream cheese, softened

- 1/2 cup mayonnaise

- 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder

- 1/2 teaspoon onion powder

- 1/4 teaspoon salt

- 1/4 teaspoon pepper

#### Grits

- 4 cups low-sodium chicken or vegetable stock

- 1 cup quick-cooking grits I like the quaker 5 minute grits, but you can definitely use the stone ground if you’re a grit purist! – just follow the directions they come with.

- 1/4 teaspoon salt

- 1/4 teaspoon pepper

- 6 slices cooked bacon

- 4 eggs cooked to your liking! (poached, fried, etc)

- 1/4 cup sliced green onions for topping

## Method

#### Pimento Cheese

1. Add all ingredients together in a large bowl and mix well until combined.

#### Grits

1. As a note, I like to get the bacon started (I usually just fry it in a skillet!) and have a skillet or pot ready for your eggs.

2. Bring the stock to a boil in a medium saucepan. Once boiling, add the grits and whisk constantly until they are fully mixed into the stock, about a minute or two. Reduce the heat to low and cover, stirring once or twice more, until the grits are thicker and creamy, about 5 minutes. Stir in about 1/2 to 2/3 cup of pimento cheese until creamy. Keep the grits over the lowest heat possible and take a few minutes to cook the eggs to your liking.

3. To serve, spoon the grits into bowls. Top with an egg, a slice or 2 of bacon and some green onions. I like to serve with a spoonful of extra pimento cheese!
