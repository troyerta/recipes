## Method

#### Slow Cooker:

1. In the bowl of your slow cooker, combine the wine, milk/cream, both mustards, shallots, garlic, and a pinch each of salt and pepper.
---

2. Rub the chicken with thyme, sage, and a pinch each of salt and pepper. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. When the oil shimmers, add the chicken and sear until golden brown on both sides, about 3 minutes per side. Remove the chicken from the skillet and place directly into the slow cooker, skin side up, along with any juices left in the skillet. Add the butter.

3. Cover the slow cooker and cook on low for 4-6 hours or on high for 2-3 hours. During the last 30 minutes of cooking, add the parmesan and kale, gently tossing to combine.

4. Serve the chicken over mashed potatoes or rice and spoon the creamy mustard sauce over top the chicken. Serve with additional herbs and parmesan.

#### Stove Top:

1. In a small bowl, combine the wine, milk/cream, both mustards, and a pinch each of salt and pepper.

2. Rub the chicken with thyme, sage, and a pinch each of salt and pepper. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. When the oil shimmers, add the chicken and sear until golden brown on both sides, about 3 minutes per side. Add the shallots and garlic, cook another 3 minutes, until fragrant.

3. Reduce the heat to low, pour in the wine/mustard sauce. Cover and simmer for 15 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through. Stir in the parmesan and kale, cooking another 3-5 minutes. If the sauce thickens too much, add additional wine or chicken broth to thin.
