### Slow Cooker

1. In the bowl of your slow cooker, combine the chicken, chili powder, paprika, cinnamon, 1 1/2 cups BBQ sauce, the beer, and a pinch each of salt and pepper. Cover and cook on LOW for 6 hours or on HIGH for 3-4 hours. Once the chicken is done cooking, shred with two forks. Stir in the cilantro and remaining BBQ sauce, if desired.

2. Follow the directions as directed above for steps 3-5.

### Stove-Top

2. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large heavy bottomed pot over medium-high heat. When the oil shimmers, add the chicken and sear the chicken on both sides, about 3-4 minutes. Reduce the heat to low and add 1 1/2 cups BBQ sauce and the beer. Cover and simmer the chicken for 1-2 hours. If the sauce gets too thick, add additional beer to thin the sauce out. Once the chicken is done cooking, shred with two forks and stir in the cilantro and remaining BBQ sauce, if desired.

2. Follow the directions as directed above for steps 3-5.
