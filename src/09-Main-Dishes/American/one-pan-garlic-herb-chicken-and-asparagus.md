# One Pan Garlic Herb Chicken and Asparagus

## Overview

- Yield: 4

## Ingredients

- 3-6 chicken thighs or boneless skinless chicken breasts (breasts pounded to even 1/2 inch thickness)

- salt and pepper, to taste

- 1 pound asparagus, ends trimmed

- 3 tablespoons butter, divided

- 1 tablespoon minced garlic

- 1/2 teaspoon dried basil (see note)

- 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano

- 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme

- 1/2 teaspoon onion powder

- salt and pepper, to taste

- fresh herbs for garnish (optional)

## Method

1. Season chicken with salt and pepper on both sides. Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a large pan/skillet over medium-high heat. Stir in garlic and herbs and cook another minute or so until the garlic is fragrant.

2. Reduce heat to medium, add chicken to pan, and cook for 5-7 minutes, then flip and cook another 5-7 minutes. (Chicken should be nearly, but not completely cooked through by this point)
---

3. Scoot the chicken over the sides and add remaining 1 tablespoon butter to the empty portion of the pan. Once the butter is melted, add asparagus. Season asparagus with salt and pepper, to taste. Cook, rotating throughout, for 4-6 minutes until tender and chicken is completely cooked through.

4. Serve immediately garnished with freshly cracked black pepper and fresh herbs if desired.

## Notes

- In place of the dried basil, oregano, and thyme, you can use about 1 1/2 teaspoons dried Italian seasoning.
