# Creamy Beef Noodle Bake

## Overview

- Yield: 8
- Prep Time: 20 mins
- Cook Time: 20 mins
- Total Time: 40 mins

## Ingredients

- 1 lb ground beef

- 1 can (15 oz) tomato sauce

- 1/2 teaspoon salt

- 1/4 teaspoon pepper

- 1/2 teaspoon onion powder

- 1 package (12 oz) egg noodles

- 3/4 cup sour cream

- 2 cups cottage cheese 16 oz container

- 2 cups shredded cheese I use Colby Jack

## Method

1. Heat oven to 350 degrees. Prepare a 9x13 baking dish and spray with cooking spray.
---

2. Cook the ground beef in a skillet until no longer pink. Drain any excess fat.
---

3. Add in the tomato sauce, salt, pepper, and onion powder into the meat and let simmer on low while you prepare the rest.
---

4. Cook the egg noodles according to package directions [don't forget to salt the water!]
---

5. In large bowl, mix together the sour cream and the cottage cheese.
---

6. Drain the noodles and pour them into the mixing bowl with the sour cream and cottage cheese. Stir to coat all the noodles.
---

7. Pour half the egg noodle mixture into your prepared pan, top with half the ground beef mixture, and then half the shredded cheese. Repeat.
---

8. Bake for 20 minutes.

## Notes

- Egg noodles tend to cook for 1 minute less than what the package calls for. They will cook slightly more when they bake in the oven.

- For best results, don't use low-fat or fat-free cottage cheese or sour cream, but the dish will suffer.

- Dish can be divided into two 8x8 pans (instead of one big 9x13), cook one right away for dinner and the other to the fridge for another night. Should keep in the fridge for 2-3 days. Just bake as directed.
