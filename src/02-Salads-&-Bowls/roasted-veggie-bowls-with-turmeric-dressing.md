# Roasted Veggie Bowls with Turmeric Dressing

## Overview

- Yield: 2
- Prep Time: 5 mins
- Cook Time: 20 mins
- Total Time: 25 mins

## Ingredients

- 2 small sweet potatoes

- 2 small heads of broccoli

- 1/2 cup quinoa

- 1 cup water

- 1 tbsp oil of choice (I used avocado)

#### For the Turmeric Dressing:

- 1/4 cup tahini

- 1/2 tsp ground turmeric

- juice of 1 lemon

- 2 minced garlic cloves

- 1/4 tsp ground ginger

- 1 tbsp avocado oil

- 2 tbsps water

- 1 tsp apple cider vinegar

- salt and pepper to taste

- 1/4 tsp cayenne (optional - I like it spicy!)

## Method

1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Wash and cut your veggies into chunks. Place them evenly on a baking sheet. Coat them with oil and salt and pepper. Toss them until they're evenly coated with the spices + oil. Roast for 20 minutes, flipping them halfway through at 10 minutes.

2. Meanwhile, put 1/2 cup of quinoa with 1 cup of water on the stove on high heat. Let it come to a boil. Once boiling, turn it down to simmer and cover it. Let it sit for 15 minutes. Once done, season with salt, pepper and garlic powder. Add a splash of oil if it gets dry.

3. For the turmeric dressing, toss all of the ingredients listed above in a food processor and blend! If it's too thick, you may need to add additional water (but I didn't have that problem!)

4. Assemble your bowls. Add quinoa on the bottom, top with the sweet potatoes and broccoli and finish it off with a drizzle of the dressing.
