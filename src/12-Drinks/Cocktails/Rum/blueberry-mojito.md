# Blueberry Mojito

## Overview

- Serves: 1

- Prep Time: 5 mins

- Total Time: 5 mins

## Ingredients

- 8 blueberries (fresh or frozen and thawed), plus more for serving

- 2 tablespoons (1 ounce) fresh squeezed lime juice

- 2 teaspoons sugar 8 fresh mint leaves, plus more for serving

- 1/4 cup (2 ounces) white rum

- 2 tablespoons (1 ounce) club soda

- Ice

- Lime slice for serving

## Method

1. Add blueberries, lime juice, sugar and eight mint leaves to a cocktail shaker. Use the end of a wooden spoon or cocktail muddler to bash (or muddle) the mint into the lime juice and sugar. This releases oils from the mint, breaks up the blueberries and helps the sugar dissolve into the lime juice.
