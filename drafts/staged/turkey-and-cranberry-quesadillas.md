2. Add turkey. I pulled it apart, kind of shredding it, with my fingers.
---

3. Then add another layer of cheese.
---

4. Next spread cranberry sauce over those layers.
---

5. Sprinkle another layer of cheese.

6. Put the other tortilla on top of the whole thing. Melt butter in a skillet,over medium heat. As soon as the butter is melted add the quesadilla. I like to cover my skillet with a lid because it helps warm the whole quesadilla. Let fry until golden brown. Flip, cover with a lid, and let the other side get brown.It should take just a few minutes

7. Remove quesadilla to a cutting board. Allow to rest for a minute or two. Cut into wedges.

8. Sprinkle quesadillas with chopped parsley.
