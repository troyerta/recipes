2. For the Sausage - Heat a medium size skillet on medium heat and add the sausage. While cooking the sausage break it up in small pieces with a spoon or heat resistant spatula.  When the sausage is thoroughly cooked remove it from the pan on to a paper towel-lined plate and set aside.

3. For the Scrambled Eggs - In a medium size bowl, add the eggs, pepper, and milk. Whisk together. Heat a medium size non-stick skillet on medium heat and add the butter. As the butter melts, pour in the eggs and stir as they cook. When the eggs are thoroughly cooked, remove the pan from the heat and set aside for just a moment.

4. For the Quesadillas - Grease a cookie sheet with butter. Lay two of the tortillas on the cookie sheet.  Add a layer of shredded cheese on each tortilla reserving half of the cheese for later. Add a layer of cooked sausage, scrambled eggs, and salsa to the tortillas. Add the remaining shredded cheese.  Top with another tortilla. Brush melted butter on top of each tortilla.

5. Bake in a preheated oven until the cheese melts and the outside edges of the tortillas turn a light golden color (about 15 to 18 minutes).

6. Cut each quesadilla into quarters with a knife or pizza cutter. Serve hot with your favorite salsa.
