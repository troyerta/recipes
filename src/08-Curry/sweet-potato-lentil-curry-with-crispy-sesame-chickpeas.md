3. Meanwhile, make the chickpeas. Heat a large, high sided skillet over medium heat. Add the 2 tablespoons oil and the chickpeas. Cook, stirring occasionally until the chickpeas are crisped all over, about 5 minutes. Add the soy sauce and sesame seeds, tossing to combine. Cook 1 minute, remove from the heat.
