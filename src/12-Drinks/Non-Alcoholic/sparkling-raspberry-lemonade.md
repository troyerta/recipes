2. If you don't want the seeds to be present in your lemonade, you can strain the syrup through a cheese cloth or sieve pressing on the seeds to get as much syrup through as possible. This part is a little annoying but it really only takes a few minutes. Discard leftover seeds

3. Just before your party, combine the raspberry lemonade mixture with your club soda in your punch bowl and toss in fresh raspberries and lemon slices for prettiness.

4. Note: If you want to make individual cups, add ice to a tall glass then top with 1/3 cup of raspberry syrup and gently pour in 1 cup club soda then toss in some raspberries and a slice of lemon for vacation effect
