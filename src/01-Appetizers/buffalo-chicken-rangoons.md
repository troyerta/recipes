# Buffalo Chicken Rangoons

## Ingredients

- 1 chicken breast

- 12 oz wonton wrappers (or make your own like we did!)

- 8 oz cream cheese

- ½ cup Buffalo sauce

- 1 tsp garlic powder

- ½ red onion

- salt and pepper

## Method

1. First, cut the chicken into strips. Place the saucepan over the high heat, add the chicken and bring to a boil. Boil until cooked through.

2. In a food processor, add the onion, cooked chicken, cream cheese, buffalo sauce, onion powder, and garlic. Mix well until smooth and combined. Season with salt and pepper.

3. Next, place a wonton on a flat surface, spoon the buffalo chicken mixture onto the center of each one. Then, wet all four edges of the wonton with water, using your finger. Then fold over into a triangle, pinching the edges to seal it.

4. After that, place a deep frying pan over the high heat, and fill it with 2 inches of oil. When the oil is hot (350F), fry in batches, adding a few rangoons at the time. Fry until golden, flipping often, about 20 seconds per rangoon.

5. When done, transfer them onto a paper towel and allow to cool slightly before serving. Serve warm, with some extra hot sauce on the side.
