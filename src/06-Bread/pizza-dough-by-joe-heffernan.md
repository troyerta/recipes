# Recipe Name

## Overview

- Yield: dough for 3 pies
- Prep Time: 2 hr
- Total Time: 24 hr

## Equipment

- Digital instant-read thermometer

- Wooden spoon

- Stand mixer

- Digital scale

## Ingredients

- 415g Bread flour

- 9g Salt

- 270g Water

- 1.5g Cake yeast, or 1g dry yeast

- Olive oil, for greasing, as needed

## Method

#### Combine flour and salt
In a medium-sized bowl, mix bread flour and salt thoroughly.

#### Combine water and yeast

- Using a thermometer, adjust sink tap until it reaches a temperature of 65 °F / 18 °C. Add water to a new bowl.

- Add cake yeast and gently stir to combine.

#### Add Yest to Flour Mixture

- Make a well in the center of the flour.

- Pour in the water and yeast.

#### Mix Roughly

- Using a wooden spoon, mix ingredients together until you have a shaggy, rugged mass of dough.

#### Mix in stand mixer

- In a stand mixer equipped with the dough hook, mix dough on medium speed for about seven and a half minutes, or until the dough has formed a uniform mass and pulls cleanly away from the sides of the bowl.

#### Shape dough

- Dust your work surface with flour.

- Turn dough onto the work surface and shape into a ball.

#### Ferment

- Ferment dough for 5 - 8 hours in a covered container.

- NOTE: Make sure that the temperature of the room is conducive to fermentation. It should be around 65 °F / 18 °C in there.

#### Portion and Shape

- Using a scale, divide the dough into 230 g portions. Shape each portion into a ball.

- Pour a dollop of olive oil into the palm of your hand, and lightly roll each ball on the countertop to cover with oil. This helps the dough retain moisture as it rests in the next step.

#### Rest

- Transfer dough to the fridge and chill, uncovered, for 10–30 minutes.

- Cover with an airtight lid and let rest overnight in the fridge.

#### Proof

- Proof in warm room until dough is relaxed and ready to stretch, about 20 minutes.

#### Stretch into a pie shape

- Each pie should be about 36 - 40 cm (14 - 15 in) across.
