## Ingredients

- 2 heads of roasted garlic refer to the post for directions if you don't know how, it's simple!

- 2 tablespoons Pompeian Picholini Olive Oil or sub for regular Pomepian Olive Oil

- 1 cup heavy cream dividied

- heaping ¼ cup sour cream

- 1 14 oz container of tortellini refrigerated or frozen - if using frozen, cook according to directions beforehand

- 3 tablespoons of butter

## Method

1. In a food processor or blender, combine the 2 heads of roasted garlic cloves, 2 tablespoons of Pompeian olive oil, & ¼ cup of the heavy cream. Blend until the garlic is pulverized. Into the garlic mixture, pour in the remaining ¾ cup heavy cream, heaping ¼ cup sour cream, & ½ cup shredded Parmesan cheese. Season to taste with salt & pepper. Blend the mixture for 30-60 seconds until everything is combined. The mixture will be thick & slightly lumpy, which is perfectly normal! Set the sauce aside.

2. Melt 3 tablespoons of butter in a large skillet. Add your tortellini & toss the pasta around in the melted butter to coat. Pour the sauce on top of the pasta, & stir gently to combine. Cook on medium heat for 10 minutes, stirring gently occasionally. The sauce will thicken.
