## Notes

- Berbere is an Ethiopian spice blend. You may be able to find it in specialty stores, however I made my own using the recipe below.

- This stew is medium-spicy. If you don't like spice, you will need to reduce the cayenne/red pepper flakes in the berbere spice blend. If you want it SPICY!! then you will want to double the cayenne/ red pepper flakes.

- This is a very hearty stew! Â¾ cup is plenty for one person.
