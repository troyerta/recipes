## Method

1. Creamy Lemon Garlic and Creamy Sun Dried Tomato Instant Pot Chicken Breasts
---

2. Combine all ingredients in a 6 quart Instant Pot (unless listed as 'after reducing sauce'.
---

3. Cook on high pressure for 8 minutes (for average 7 oz chicken breasts; see note). Release the pressure when the Instant Pot beeps (quick pressure release).
---

4. Using a pair of tongs, carefully remove the chicken from the Instant Pot and allow to rest while you reduce the sauce.
---

5. Reduce the sauce: select 'sautee' on the Instant Pot, and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 7-10 minutes.
---

6. When roughly 1/3 of a cup of the sauce remains (and you start to see the bottom of the IP as you stir), stir in the parmesan cheese, cream, and lemon (for the lemon garlic chicken only). Stir until cheese is melted and sauce is heated through (but not boiling), and remove the pot from the Instant Pot base using oven mitts.
---

7. Spoon the sauce over chicken breast, rice and veggies.
---

#### Thai Red Curry and Coconut Sweet Chili Instant Pot Chicken Breasts:

1. Combine all ingredients in 6 quart Instant Pot (unless listed as 'after cooking').
---

2. Cook on high pressure for 8 minutes (for average 7 oz chicken breasts; see note). Release the pressure when the Instant Pot beeps (quick pressure release).
---

3. Using a pair of tongs, carefully remove the chicken from the Instant Pot and allow to rest while you cook the veggies.
---

4. Add quick cooking veggies such as thinly sliced bell peppers, bok choy, and snap peas to the Instant Pot and select 'sautee'. Cook, stirring frequently, for 3-5 minutes, until veggies are tender.
---

5. Slice chicken and return to the pot. Stir in the lime juice (Thai Curry only).
---

6. Serve over rice, spooning the sauce over everything.
---

#### Soy Ginger, Honey Sesame and Chipotle Lime Instant Pot Chicken Breasts:

1. Combine all ingredients in 6 quart Instant Pot (unless listed as 'after cooking').
---

2. Cook on high pressure for 8 minutes (for average 7 oz chicken breasts; see note). Release the pressure when the Instant Pot beeps (quick pressure release).
---

3. Using a pair of tongs, carefully remove the chicken from the Instant Pot and allow to rest while you thicken the sauce (you can also add some veggies in at this point and cook for 3-5 minutes before adding the cornstarch).
---

4. Mix the cornstarch with 2 tablespoons of water, then add the slurry into the Instant Pot. Select 'sautee', and simmer for 1-2 minutes, until sauce is thickened to your liking.
---

5. Serve over rice (soy ginger and honey chipotle), or in tacos (chipotle lime).

## Notes

- The cook time of 8 minutes works perfectly for average sized 7 oz chicken breasts. For smaller portions, reduce the cook time 1-2 minutes, and for larger portions, increase the cook time by 1-2 minutes.
