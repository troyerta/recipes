## Ingredients

#### For Flautas:

- 1 tbsp olive oil

- 1 medium onion chopped

- 3 cloves garlic minced

- 3/4 cup corn canned and drained

- 2 chicken breasts I used 2 chicken breasts from a roasted chicken, cooked and shredded

- 1 cup salsa store bought

- 1/2 cup sour cream

- 1 1/2 cups Tex Mex or Mexican cheese blend, I used Kraft

- 10 flour tortillas 6 inch

- 1/4 cup butter unsalted, melted

#### For Guacamole:

- 1 avocado

- 1 medium tomato

- 1/2 jalapeno pepper

- 1 tbsp lime juice from 1/2 lime

- 1 tbsp cilantro chopped

- 1/2 tsp pepper or to taste

## Method

1. Preheat oven to 400 F degrees.

2. In a medium size skillet heat the olive oil. Add onion and garlic and cook until onion is softened, about 3 minutes. Add corn to skillet and cook for another 2 minutes. Add shredded chicken, salsa and sour cream, stir and cook for about 3 more minutes. Remove from heat and stir in cheese.
---
3. Warm the tortillas in the microwave for about 30 seconds so that they’re easier to roll. The chicken mixture should be enough to fill 10 tortillas.
---
4. Butter a 9×13 inch baking with some of the melted butter. Lay a tortilla flat and top with a couple tablespoons of the chicken mixture. Tightly roll up the tortilla and place it in the baking dish. Brush with melted butter. Repeat with remaining tortillas.
---
5. Bake for about 15 minutes or until tortillas turn golden brown.
---
6. While the flautas are baking, make the guacamole. In a small bowl mash the avocado then add the rest of the ingredients and stir well.
---
7. Serve guacamole over flautas and enjoy.
