- 1 1/2 cups fresh blueberries

- 1/4 cup granulated sugar

## Method

1. Remove 1 sheet of puffed pastry from the freeze; thaw for 15-20 minutes at room temperature, or until it can easily be unfolded without cracking.
---
2. Preheat oven to 400Â°(F). Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper; set aside.
---
3. In a small bowl combine the egg and water; beat until well combined; set aside.
---
4. Thinly slice peaches and place them in a large mixing bowl. Add in the sugar, salt, cinnamon, and cornstarch; toss well ensuring all peaches and are coated in the cinnamon sugar mix; set aside.
---
5. Gently unfold the puffed pastry. If it does crack, gently press the tears back together and mend with slightly wet fingers.
---
6. Place puffed pastry on prepared baking sheet.
---
7. Layer the peaches evenly (and very tightly) on the puffed pastry, making 3 tidy rows, leaving a 1" border around the pastry. Sprinkle the blueberries on top.
---
8. Lightly brush exposed pastry crust with egg wash.
---
9. Bake for 16-18 minutes, rotating once during baking, or until the crust is puffed up and golden brown and the peaches are tender.
---
10. While the tart bakes, make the vanilla glaze!
---
11. In a small bowl combine the confectioners' sugar, vanilla, and cream; whisk until smooth, adding more cream as needed to reach desired consistency. Drizzle over the tart right before serving.
---
12. Serve warm with vanilla glaze and maybe even a scoop of ice cream!?

## Notes

- Be sure to leave a one inch boarder around the tart, this helps ensure the edges don't get soggy.
