# Roasted Banana Cinnamon Buns

## Overview

- Yield: 12 buns

## Ingredients

#### For the Dough:

- 1 cup (240 ml) milk

- 1/3 cup (2½ oz) (70 gm) white sugar

- 1/3 cup (2¾ oz) (75 gm) butter

- 1 tablespoon (1/3 oz) (9 g) active dry yeast

- 4 cups (17½ oz) (500 g) all-purpose (plain) flour

- 1/2 teaspoon (3 g) salt

- 2 large eggs

- 2 tablespoons (30 ml) vegetable oil

#### For the Roasted Bananas:

- 3 bananas, cut into 1/2- 1 inch (15-30 mm) chunks

- 2 tablespoons (30 ml) (1 oz) (25 gm) brown sugar

- 1 1/2 tablespoons (25 ml) (¾ oz)(20 gm) butter, cut into small pieces

#### For the Filling:

- 1/2 cup (3½ oz) (100 gm) brown sugar, firmly packed

- 1-1/2 tablespoons (1 oz) (25 g) cinnamon

- All of the mashed roasted bananas

#### For Assembly:

- Risen dough

- Prepared filling

- 4 tablespoons (½ stick) (2 oz) (55 g) butter, room temperature (almost melted is great)

#### For the Glaze (Nb: I Only Needed Half Of This Amount):

- 1 cup (240 ml) (4½ oz) (125 gm) confectioner’s (icing) sugar

- 1 tablespoon (15 ml) maple syrup

- 2-4 tablespoons (30-60 ml) milk

## Method

1. For the dough: In a small saucepan over medium heat, combine the milk, sugar and butter. Heat gently till the sugar dissolves. If it’s become quite hot, cool to warm and stir in the yeast. Let is stand until foamy, about 10 minutes.

2. In a large bowl, stir together the flour and salt. Mix in the eggs, oil and the yeast mixture. Mix until dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Turn dough out onto a floured surface and continue to knead until the dough is smooth and elastic, about 10-15 minutes. Grease a large bowl with 1 tablespoon of oil. Place the dough into the bowl and turn once to coat. Cover and let stand in a warm place until double in size, about 1 hour. In the meantime, prepare the roasted bananas and filling.

3. For the roasted bananas: Preheat oven to 200°C (400°F). Spread the banana chunks into a 1 1/2-2 quart (1½ -2 litre) baking dish. Sprinkle with the brown sugar and dot the top with the butter pieces. Roast the bananas for 40 minutes, stirring after about 20 minutes. When the bananas have cooled a bit, mash them with a fork.

4. For the filling: Mix together the brown sugar, cinnamon and mashed roasted bananas until well combined.

5. For assembly: Once the dough has risen, gently deflate it. Roll the dough into a big rectangle (I rolled it out to 30 x 50cm (12 x 20 inch). Spread the butter over the dough. Spread the banana/brown sugar mixture over the butter. It will most likely mix right in with the butter, and that is totally okay.

6. Starting with one long end, roll the dough into a log (this can be a bit of a messy process and some of the filling might spill out, but I gathered it up and pushed it back into the cut pieces once they were in the pan). Cut the log into 12 pieces, and place each piece, cut side up, into a 23 x 33 cm (9 x 13 inch) pan, ensuring there is some room between each for them to expand while proving a second time. Cover the pan with plastic wrap and place it into the refrigerator overnight. (Or, let it rest for about 30 minutes to an hour or so, and proceed to the baking directions.)
---

7. In the morning, take the tray out of the refrigerator and allow it to come up to temperature for at least 30 minutes.
---

8. Preheat oven to 190°C (375°F). Bake the cinnamon buns for 25-30 minutes or until or until when lightly tapped the bread sounds hollow, and a skewer inserted into the thickest part of the bread comes out clean. If the rolls are browning too quickly, cover them lightly with foil during the last 5-10 minutes of baking. When ready, take out and place the pan on a wire rack.
---

9. For the glaze: Measure the confectioner’s sugar into a medium bowl. Whisk in the maple syrup and enough milk (adding it a little at a time) to make a good, easily pourable consistency.
---

10. Drizzle glaze over cinnamon buns in the pan while still hot. When cool enough to handle, pull or cut apart the buns and place on a cooling rack. Serve while still warm.
