## Ingredients

#### Cake:

- 1 cup self-raising flour I used Orgran Gluten Free SR Flour

- 1/2 cup caster sugar super fine

- 60 g butter

- 1 large egg lightly beaten

- icing sugar/confectioners' sugar optional, for dusting

#### Filling:

- 1/2 cup lemon juice strained

- 1/2 cup caster sugar super fine

- 1 egg lightly beaten

- 60 g butter chopped

## Method

1. Preheat your oven to 180 Degrees C (350 F)
---

2. Grease and line the base and sides of a 17cm/6.5” spring-form tin* with non-stick baking paper.
---

3. Add flour, sugar, butter and lightly beaten egg to the bowl of a food processor fitted with the steel blade.
---

4. Pulse until the mixture just starts to come together.
---

5. Don’t process until the mixture forms a ball of dough, you want it to still be a little crumbly.
---

6. Tip the mixture onto some cling wrap.
---

7. Divide the mixture and gently press 2/3 into the base of the prepared tin, reserving the remaining 1/3.
---

8. Make the lemon curd as per the instructions below. Pour the hot lemon curd onto the cake base.
---

9. As evenly as possible, crumble the remaining mixture over the top of the curd.
---

10. Bake until golden brown, about 30 minutes.
---

11. Remove from the oven and cool completely in the pan.
---

12. Gently remove the side of the spring-form tin.
---

13. Remove the baking paper, place the cake on a serving platter and dust the tea cake with
---

14. icing/confectioners’ sugar.
---

15. Lovely served on its own, or with a dollop of cream.
---

#### Lemon Curd Filling:

1. Place all filling ingredients in a saucepan.*
---

2. Over a low heat, stir until the butter has melted and the curd thickens, just below boiling point.
---

3. Don’t be tempted to use high heat to make the process quicker; you will end up with scrambled egg.
---


## Notes

- You can also use regular wheat flour for this recipe.

- My tin was about 18.5 cm/7.25” – slightly smaller may be preferable, but I still had enough cake mixture for that size tin.

- The curd is very simple to make. This curd does not require a double boiler as many recipes do. However, it does mean that you must cook it over a low heat.
