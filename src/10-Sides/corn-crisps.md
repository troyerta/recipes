# Corn Crisps

## Overview

- Yield: 10 - 16 crisps

## Ingredients

- 1/2 cup flour

- 1 tsp kosher salt, plus more for sprinkling

- 3/4 tsp baking powder

- 1/2 tsp cumin

- 1/4 tsp sugar

- 1/8 tsp cayenne pepper [optional]

- 1 large egg

- 1/4 cup milk

- 1 T [tablespoon] unsalted butter, melted

- 1-1/2 cups can or frozen corn, thawed if frozen [I think it could do with MORE corn, so try adding 2 cups]

- 1/4 cup finely chopped scallions

- Canola or vegetable oil

## Method

1. In a large bowl, combine flour, salt, baking powder, cumin, sugar, and cayenne.
---

2. In a medium bowl, whisk together the egg, milk, and butter.
---

3. Stir the wet ingredients into the dry until they are just blended. Fold in the corn and scallions.
---

4. Pour oil in large nonstick skillet [until it come up 1/4 inch on the sides] and heat over medium-high heat until the oil is shimmering.
---

5. For each crisp, drop a slightly rounded tablespoon of batter into the oil. Fry them in batches over medium-high heat until they are golden, about 2 to 3 minutes.
---

6. Transfer the crisps to a paper towel-lined sheet pan, sprinkling them immediately with a bit of salt. [this can be taken out--it was pretty salty with the sprinkled salt on top, in my opinion]
---

7. Repeat with the remaining batter.
