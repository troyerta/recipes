## Ingredients

#### Cauli Salad:

2. Cauliflower Prep: Working in batches, run the cauliflower florets through a food processor until you get “rice” – it should take about 20-30 pulses.

3. Dressing: Shake up all the ingredients in a jar, or whisk together. Taste and adjust.

4. Assembly: Toss everything together. That’s it!

## Notes

- If going sugar free is important to you, make sure to look for a mustard without sugar.

- I like to reserve a few chickpeas and herbs to top the salad, just to make it pretty.

- This salad doesn’t last long once tossed together, so if you’re prepping in advance, keep everything separate.

- Maple syrup or agave would be a perfect sub to make this recipe vegan.
