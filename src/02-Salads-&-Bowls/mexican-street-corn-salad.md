## Method

#### For the Grilled Mexican Street Corn Salad :

1. To prep the corn: Fold the husk of each corn back leaf by leaf and tie them with kitchen twine. Lightly brush corn on the cub with oil.
---

2. Heat a grill pan or an outdoor grill. Grill corn, turning occasionally until it is charred in spots. Keep an eye on it as this happens rather quickly.
---

3. Cut the corn off the cob and place the corn in a large bowl. Set aside to cool.
---

4. To make the Mexican Corn Dressing: Mix together mayonnaise, sour cream, chili powder, lime juice, salt and pepper in a small bowl.
---

5. To assemble the Mexican Corn Salad: Pour the corn dressing over the corn. Add in jalapeno, onion, and cilantro. Give it a gentle toss. Make sure that the dressing is distributed equally throughout the salad.
---

6. Transfer the salad to a salad plate and top it off with cotija cheese and garnish with cilantro.

#### For the Skillet Roasted Mexican Street Corn Salad :

1. To prep the corn: Cut the corn off the cob. I used 6 ears to get about 4 ½ to 5 cups. Alternatively, you can also use canned corn or frozen corn. If using frozen, you do not need to thaw it out.
---

2. Heat oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Stir in the corn, and stirring frequently, sauté for 5-7 minutes until it starts to get (lightly) chared. If you are using frozen corn, you might need to cook a few minutes longer. Transfer to a bowl and set aside.
