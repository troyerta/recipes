# Herbed Ricotta Cheesy Bread

## Overview

- Yield: 1 x 9" loaf
- Prep Time: 15 mins
- Cook Time: 45 mins
- Total Time: 60 mins

## Ingredients

- 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted until browned

- 4 ounces Parmesan cheese, coarsely grated, divided

- 2 and 1/2 cups all-purpose flour

- 1 tablespoon baking powder

- 1 and 1/2 tablespoons fresh rosemary, very finely chopped

- 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper

- 1/4 teaspoon freshly cracked black pepper

- 1 teaspoon salt

- 1 tablespoon light brown sugar

- 8 ounces mozzarella cheese, cubed

- 1 cup whole milk

- 1/2 cup whole milk ricotta cheese

- 1 large egg, at room temperature

## Method

1. Place the butter in a small sauce pan over medium-high heat and cook for about 3 minutes – stirring almost constantly – until the butter has turned an amber gold/brown and smells slightly nutty. Remove from heat and set aside until needed.

3. Spray a 9 OR 10" loaf pan with non-stick baking spray. Sprinkle half of the Parmesan cheese on the bottom of the pan and set aside.

4. In a large bowl add the flour, baking powder, rosemary, cayenne pepper, black pepper, salt, and brown sugar; mix well to combine. Add in the cubed mozzarella and toss with your hands, making sure each cube gets coated in the flour mixture. Make a well in the center of the flour. Add in the milk, ricotta cheese, and egg. Use a fork to lightly whisk the wet ingredients together, then use a rubber spatula to gently fold the wet ingredients into the dry ones. Stop folding when you can still see just a little flour. It's important not to over mix here! fold in the browned butter until just combined. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and smooth the top. Sprinkle with remaining Parmesan cheese, and bake for 45 to 55 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then invert onto a plate, then flip it back (right side up) onto a cooling rack and cool for at least 30 minutes before slicing. This bread actually tastes better the longer you let it cool.
