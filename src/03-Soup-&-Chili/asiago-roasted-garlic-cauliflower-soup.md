## Method

#### For the soup:

1. Toss the cauliflower in the oil, salt and pepper and arrange in a single layer on a baking sheet.
----
2. Cut the top 1/4 off the heads of garlic, drizzle the oil on top, wrap in foil and place on the baking sheet along with the cauliflower.
----
3. Roast in a preheated 425F/220C oven until the cauliflower is tender and lightly golden brown to a little charred, about 20-30 minutes, mixing the cauliflower half way through.
----
4. Heat the oil in a large sauce pan over medium-high heat, add the onion and cook until tender, about 3-5 minutes.
----
5. Add the thyme and cook until fragrant, about a minute.
----
6. Add the broth, roasted cauliflower and garlic, squeezed from the skins, bring to a boil, reduce the heat and simmer for 10 minutes before pureeing with a stick blender, in a blender or in a food processor.
----
7. Mix in the miso and asiago and heat until the cheese melts into the soup, about a minute, before adding the lemon juice.
----

#### For the crunchy topping:

1. Heat the quinoa in a pan over medium heat until the quinoa starts popping, and then slows down until there is more than a second between pops, mixing continuously to prevent burning.
----
2. Mix in the breadcrumbs, seeds, asiago and toast for a minute or two.
----
3. Mix in the lemon zest and parsley before serving as garnish on the soup.
----

#### Option:
Start by cooking bacon in the pan until crispy before setting aside and continuing on with step 4 using the bacon grease instead of oil to cook the onions in.

#### Option:
Add 1 cup heavy cream, milk or almond milk, etc. to make it creamier.

#### Option:
Add 1/4 cup tahini to the soup to make it extra creamy.
