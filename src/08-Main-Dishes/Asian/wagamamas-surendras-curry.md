4. Time to move on to the deep fried sweet potato! Peel and grate the sweet potato onto some kitchen cloth to soak up any extra moisture. Fill a medium sized saucepan with the vegetable oil and place it over a medium heat. Deep fry the grated sweet potato in small batches for 2-3 minutes until crispy, adding salt to the saucepan with each batch. Remove with a slotted spoon and place on a paper towel to soak up the excess oil.
