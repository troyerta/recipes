# Cinnamon Rock Candy Recipe

## Overview

- Prep Time:20 mins
- Total Time: 1 hour?

## Ingredients

- 2 cups white sugar

- 3/4 cup cold water

- 2/3 cup light corn syrup

## Method

1. Grease a 15x10x1" baking sheet with nonstick cooking spray and set aside.
---
2. In a large saucepan, add sugar, water and corn syrup and mix well. Attach a candy thermometer onto the edge of the pan.
---
3. Heat over medium heat stirring constantly until sugar dissolves.
---
4. Once sugar is dissolved, stop stirring and let mixture boil. Continue to boil until the temperature reaches 250 degrees F. Add color. Do not stir, the boiling will mix the color.
---
5. When mixture comes to 300 degrees F, remove from heat. Once no longer boiling, add flavor and gently stir. Use caution as the mixture will bubble up. Pour into prepared pan. Let set and the bubbles will disappear.
---
6. When cool, break into pieces by dropping pan onto a hard, flat surface. Beak apart any large pieces and place into a sealable bag with 2 tablespoons of powdered sugar (add more if necessary). Shake bag to coat well.
---
7. Remove from bag and enjoy.
---
8. Store in a resealable container or bag.

## Notes

- Popular flavors are cinnamon and peppermint, but you could use any flavor

- I highly recommend you spray your measuring cup with cooking spray before adding corn syrup. It won’t stick in the measuring cup.

- Boiling sugar is incredibly dangerous. Make sure you are careful not to get even one drop on your skin and that children stay safely back.

- You can store the candy at room temperature for up to a week in a plastic bag or container, but I don’t really think you’ll have it sitting around that long.
