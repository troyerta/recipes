#### Roasted Garlic Parmesan Hummus:

- 1 and 3/4 cups cooked chickpeas (about one  15 ounce can – drain, rinse, and reserve 1/4 cup liquid)

- 4 roasted garlic cloves, chopped (here is how I roast garlic)

- 1/4 cup olive oil

- 1/4 cup tahini, stirred well

- 1/4 cup grated parmesan cheese

- 1/4 teaspoon fresh ground black pepper

- 1/4 teaspoon cumin

- 2 Tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice

- 1/4 cup reserved chickpea liquid or water

- sea salt, to taste

## Method

1. Make the pita chips: Preheat oven to 400°F (204°C)s. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat. Set aside.

2. Cut each pita into 8 triangles and arrange on the baking sheet. In a small bowl, whisk the oil, garlic powder, and lemon pepper together until combined. Brush each pita triangle with mixture. Flip each pita triangle over and brush the other side. Give them a light sprinkle of sea salt. Bake pita triangles for 10 minutes, or until browned and crispy. Allow to cool as you prepare the hummus.

3. Make the hummus: Peel the skins off of all the chickpeas. This may be done in advance to save time if you prefer – cover the peeled chickpeas and keep in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. Place the chickpeas into your food processor or high speed blender and pulse until they are somewhat mashed. Add the chopped garlic, olive oil, tahini, parmesan, pepper, cumin, and lemon juice. Process until creamy for at least 1 minute. You may need to stop and start the processor a few times to get things moving. Add the reserved chickpea liquid and process for 1 more minute. Taste – and add a little salt (and/or chopped garlic, pepper, cumin) if needed. I usually never add salt, though that is just a personal preference. Add more olive oil and/or reserved chickpea liquid to thin out if needed.

4. Spoon the hummus into a bowl and drizzle with additional olive oil, a sprinkle of parmesan, a couple pieces of chopped roasted garlic, and a sprinkle of fresh ground pepper if desired. Serve with spiced pita chips and fresh veggies.

## Notes

- Make Ahead Instructions: This hummus tastes best up to 5 days in the refrigerator. Make ahead and cover tightly before serving. Store the chips in zipped-top bag or tupperware for up to 2 weeks.
