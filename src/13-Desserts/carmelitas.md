# Carmelitas

Carmelitas are a no-mixer, layered bar, and the crust and topping are made with the same buttery, brown sugar, vanilla-infused oatmeal and flour mixture. In the middle there’s chocolate and caramel sauce.

## Overview

- Yield: One 8x8 pan, 9 to 12 squares
- Prep Time: 15 mins
- Cook Time: 25 to 28 minutes, divided
- Total Time: 4+ hours or overnight, for proper cooling

## Ingredients

- 3/4 cup butter, melted (1 1/2 stick; I use unsalted butter but salted may be used)

- 3/ 4 cup light brown sugar, packed

- 1 tablespoon vanilla extract

- 1 cup all-purpose flour

- 1 cup whole-rolled old fashioned oats (not instant or quick cook)

- 1 teaspoon baking soda

- Pinch salt, optional and to taste

- 35 caramel squares, unwrapped (I used Werther’s Originals Baking Caramels which are slightly bigger than cellophane-wrapped caramels; if using those, I recommend using a couple more)

- 1/2 cup heavy cream

- 1/2 teaspoon salt, optional and to taste, if you prefer salted caramel sauce

- 1 cup (6 ounces) semi-sweet chocolate chips or chunks (I used a combo)

## Method

1. Preheat oven to 350F.
---
2. Line an 8×8-inch pan with aluminum foil and spray with cooking spray. Lining your pan is highly recommended for ease of cleanup due to the stickiness of the caramel; set pan aside.
---
3. In a large microwave-safe mixing bowl, add the butter and heat on high power to melt, about 90 seconds.
---
4. Add the brown sugar, vanilla, and whisk until smooth.
---
5. Add the flour, oats, baking soda, optional pinch salt, and stir until combined. Mixture will be quite thick.
---
6. Add half of the mixture to the prepared pan (just eyeball it), and smooth it with spatula or the back of a spoon, to create an even, smooth, flat layer; set remainder aside.
---
7. Bake for 10 minutes. While it bakes, make the caramel sauce.
---
8. In a large microwave-safe mixing bowl, combine the caramels, cream, and heat on high power in 60-second bursts to melt caramels, stirring after each burst. It will likely take about 4 to 5 minutes total to melt; heat until mixture can be stirred smooth. Alternatively, combine caramels and cream in a medium saucepan, and heat over medium-low heat to melt, stirring nearly continuously, until mixture can be stirred smooth.
---
9. Optionally stir in 1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste, for salted caramel sauce; set sauce aside.
---
10. After 10 minutes, remove pan from the oven and evenly sprinkle with the chocolate.
---
11. Slowly and evenly pour caramel sauce over the chocolate.
---
12. Evenly crumble reserved oatmeal-brown sugar mixture over the top.
---
13. Return pan to oven and bake for about 15 to 18 minutes (I baked 16 1/2), or until edges are lightly browned and center is bubbling slightly.
---
14. Allow bars to cool completely in the pan before slicing and serving, giving the molten caramel time to firm up. This can take up to 4 hours, or overnight, at room temperature. You can speed it up by placing pan in fridge with a sheet of foil over the top to prevent fridge smells. If you don’t wait for bars to cool completely, they’ll be a literal hot mess. They’ll taste fine (don’t burn yourself), but they won’t slice neatly with clean cuts. Bars will keep airtight at room temperature for up to 1 week, or in the freezer for up to 4 months.
