# Chewy Chocolate Espresso Cookies

## Overview

- Yield: 30 cookies

## Ingredients

- 12 tablespoons unsalted butter melted and slightly cooled

- 1/2 cup cocoa powder I prefer Nestle

- 1 cup sugar

- 2 tablespoons unsulphered molasses I like Brer Rabbit Mild Flavor

- 1 egg

- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

- 1 packets Starbucks Via or 1 teaspoon espresso powder

- 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour

- 1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda

- 1/2 teaspoons salt

- 1/2 cup sugar for rolling

## Method

1. In a large bowl, stir the cocoa and molasses into the warm butter. In medium bowl combine flour, baking soda, and salt. Add 1 c. sugar, egg, vanilla extract and Via (or espresso powder) to the butter mixture. Stir dry ingredients into the wet. Cover and chill dough for as little as an hour or up to 3 days.

2. When ready to bake, preheat oven to 350 degrees. Roll a generous tablespoon of dough into balls (a #50 cookie scoop is great for this), and roll them in the remaining white sugar. Place cookies 2 inches apart onto ungreased baking sheets.

3. Bake cookies, one sheet at a time, for 10-12 minutes, until cookies are puffed, centers are set and they are beginning to form cracks. Do not overbake. Leave on sheets until they are cool enough to transfer to a wire rack and let cool completely.

4. If you want a slightly more substantial cookie, use a #30 cookie scoop, 2 tablespoons dough, for each cookie. You will need to add a minute or two to the bake time and the batch will make about 18 cookies instead of 30.
