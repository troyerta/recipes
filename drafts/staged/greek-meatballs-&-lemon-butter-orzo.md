## Overview

- Yield: 6 servings
- Prep Time: 25 mins
- Cook Time: 20 mins
- Total Time: 45 mins

## Ingredients

- 1 pound ground chicken

- 1 small shallot, finely chopped

- 2 cloves garlic, minced or grated

- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh oregano (or 2 teaspoons dried)

- 1 teaspoon smoked paprika

- Kosher salt and black pepper

- 1 pinch crushed red pepper flakes

- 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil

- 1 lemon, sliced, plus 3-4 tbs lemon juice

- 2 tablespoons salted butter

- 1 cup dry orzo pasta

- 1/2 cup pitted green olives

- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh dill, plus more for serving

- 1/2 cup oil packed sun-dried tomatoes, chopped, and reserve the oil

- 2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar

- Arugula and fresh herbs, for serving

#### Whipped Feta:

- 8 ounces feta cheese

- 1/4 cup plain greek yogurt

- 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil

## Method

1. Add the chicken, shallot, 1 clove garlic, oregano, paprika, and a pinch of red pepper, salt, and pepper to a bowl. Mix until just combined. Coat your hands with a bit of oil, roll the meat into tablespoon-size balls (will make 14-15 meatballs).

2. Heat a large skillet or dutch oven over medium-high heat and add 2 tablespoons oil. When the oil shimmers, add the meatballs and sear until crisp and cooked through, about 8-10 minutes, turning them 2-3 times. Transfer to a plate.
---
3. To the same skillet, add the butter and lemon slices. Sear the lemon until golden on each side, about 1 minute. Remove the lemon from the pan and add to the plate with the meatballs. To the same skillet, add 1 clove garlic and the orzo. Cook until the garlic is fragrant and the orzo toasted, about 2-3 minutes. Add the 2 1/2 cups water and 1-2 tablespoons juice from 1 lemon. Bring to a boil over high heat and cook, stirring often, until al dente, about 7-8 minutes. Stir in the olives and dill. Slide the meatballs back into the skillet and cook until warmed through.
---
4. Meanwhile, make the sun-dried tomato vinaigrette. In a bowl, whisk together 1/4 cup of the reserved sun-dried tomato oil, 2 tablespoons lemon juice, and the balsamic vinegar until combined. Stir in the sun-dried tomatoes, 1 tablespoon dill, and season with salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes.
---
5. To make the feta. Combine all ingredients in a food processor and pulse until smooth and creamy. The feta can be kept in the fridge for up to 3 days.
---
6. To serve, spread the feta onto plates and drizzle with the vinaigrette. Add the orzo, seared lemons, and meatballs. Sprinkle on some greens and herbs.

## Notes

- Whipped Feta: if you prefer you can just crumble the feta cheese over the meatballs instead of whipping it.
