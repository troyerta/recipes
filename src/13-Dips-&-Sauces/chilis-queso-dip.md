## Method

#### Slow Cooker Instructions:

1. Chop the Velveeta into chunks. Add it to a slow cooker. Add all the other ingredients (except garnishes..and tortilla chips. Did I have to say that? :)
---
2. Place the lid on top and set to high heat for 1 hour. Stir once halfway through. Or you can cook it on low for 2-3 hours, stirring once halfway through. The longer it sits, the more time the flavors have to marry, so feel free to make this ahead of time! It reheats in a jiffy (microwave, stove top, or in the slow cooker).

3. Serve with tortilla chips and garnishes!

#### Stove Top Instructions:

1. Chop the Velveeta and add to a large pot.
---
2. Add all the other ingredients and turn the heat to low.
---
3. Stir frequently until it's all melted. Serve with chips and garnishes
