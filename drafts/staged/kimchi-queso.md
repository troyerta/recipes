- 1 ½ cups kimchi, chopped

- 2 tablespoons korean red pepper powder, 3 tbsp if you like it spicy

2. In a medium saucepan, melt cheddar cheese part way (until it’s mostly soft but still clumpy).
---

3. Add the sour cream. Melt and stir until the mixture is smooth.
---

4. Add the red pepper powder and stir until evenly integrated.
---

5. Add kimchi and simmer until evenly mixed and smooth. The liquid from the kimchi may give the appearance that the queso is chunky, continue heating and stirring 5-10 minutes and it will smooth out.

6. Serve garnished with chopped green onion. Goes great with chips, raw vegetables, or straight into the mouth via spoon.
