# Southwestern Crispy Chicken Wraps

## Overview

- Yield: 6 WRAPS
- Prep Time: 15 mins
- Cook Time: 10 mins
- Total Time: 25 mins

## Ingredients

- 1 cup cooked rice, warm or at room temperature

- 1/2 tablespoon chili powder

- 1 teaspoon ground cumin

- 1/2 teaspoon garlic salt or garlic powder

- 1-2 cups cooked, shredded chicken (or other leftover meat, like shredded pork or beef)

- 1 can black beans, rinsed and drained

- 1 green onion, finely sliced (white and green parts)

- 1/2 red or green bell pepper, diced

- 1/4 cup fresh cilantro, chopped

- Juice of 1 lime (about a tablespoon)

- 2 cups shredded cheese (I use a combination of Monterey jack and sharp cheddar)

- Sour cream (optional)

- 6 burrito-sized flour tortillas

- Nonstick cooking spray

#### Toppings (Optional):

## Method

1. In a large bowl, add the rice, chili powder, cumin and garlic salt (or garlic powder). Stir to combine.
---

2. To the bowl, add the chicken, black beans, green onions, bell peppers, cilantro, and lime juice. Mix. Add salt and pepper to taste, if needed.
---

3. Sprinkle cheese over tortillas, leaving 1/2-inch border around edges, then arrange chicken and rice mixture down the center of each tortilla.
---

4. Optional: I like to dollop little spoonfuls of sour cream over the cheese before arranging chicken and rice mixture down the center – it makes the wraps delightfully creamy.
---

5. Fold one side of the tortilla over the filling, followed by the other side. Press lightly to flatten.
---

6. Heat a large non-stick skillet (or griddle) over medium heat for 1 minute (about 350 degrees on my electric griddle).
---

7. Spray seam side of wraps with nonstick cooking spray. Arrange wraps, seam-side down (cooking this side first will help them not fall apart), in the pan or griddle and cook until golden brown and crisp, about 2-4 minutes.
---

8. Spray the top with nonstick cooking spray and flip. Cook for another 2-4 minutes until golden and the filling is hot.
---

9. Serve with sour cream, salsa, or other toppings of your choice!

## Notes

- Variations: this is one of the most adaptable recipes on here (reading through the comments will prove that – your variations sound amazing!). Feel free to up the cilantro, add in a different meat of your choice, eliminate the pepper, add green chilies – seriously, the options are endless. You can easily use smaller tortillas to maximize the number of wraps you make.

- Add-Ins: often, I add salsa verde, and I also love subbing in chopped roasted red peppers for the diced bell pepper.

- Doubling the Recipe: I almost always double this recipe when making so I can freeze the cooled crispy wraps and freeze individually wrapped in plastic wrap (and tossed in a freezer ziploc bag with the other wraps) for quick, easily reheatable lunches!
