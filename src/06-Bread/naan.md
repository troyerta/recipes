## Overview

- Yield: 6

## Ingredients

- 2 cups all-purpose flour (organic maida or 1 cup wheat flour + 1 cup all-purpose flour)

- ½ cup plain yogurt (curd)

- 6 to 8 tablespoons luke warm milk (¼ cup + 2 tbsps) (may need more)

- 2 tablespoons oil or melted butter

- 2 teaspoons sugar

- ½ to ¾ teaspoon salt (adjust to taste)

- 1 to 1½ teaspoon grated garlic (optional)

#### For Leavening (Or Use ¾ Tsp Instant Yeast):

- ½ teaspoon baking powder

- ¼ teaspoon baking soda

#### For Toppings:

- 5 to 6 garlic cloves sliced or chopped

- 3 tablespoons melted butter

- ¼ cup coriander leaves chopped finely

- 1 tsp kalonji seeds (optional)

## Method

#### Making Dough:

1. To a mixing bowl add flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, sugar and grated garlic . (If using instant yeast in place of baking powder and baking soda add it now. To use dry active yeast, refer notes.)
---

2. Pour yogurt, oil and 4 tbsps luke warm milk. Begin to mix to form a smooth dough adding more warm milk as needed. You may need up to half cup milk.
---

3. Knead well until the dough turns soft, elastic & pliable. When you press down the dough with your finger, it should dent easily.
---

4. Optionally you can cover and rest the dough for 1 to 2 hours in a warm place. You can also make them instantly like I made here. (For yeast dough, rest in a warm place for 2 hours or until the dough rises & doubles, Then punch the dough one to 2 times to deflate slightly).
---

5. Grease your fingers and divide the dough to 6 to 8 parts depending on the size you prefer.
---

6. Make smooth balls and keep them covered until you finish rolling the naans.
---

#### How To Make Naan:

1. Sprinkle little flour on the rolling area and place a dough ball.
---

2. Roll the ball to 8 to 9 inches long and 5 to 6 inches wide depending on the size of the dough ball.
---

3. Sprinkle kalonji seeds, sliced garlic and coriander leaves. Press down or roll them gently.
---

4. When you are done with 5 to 6 naans, begin to heat a griddle or pan.
---

5. Ensure the pan is hot enough, then transfer the naan to it. Within a minute or so bubbles will be visible on top.
---

6. With the help of a tong, flip it and cook either on the pan or directly over the gas fire or stove. Or place a wired rack on the stove and toast it. (check video or step by step photos).
---

7. When you see brown spots on the naan, remove them to a plate and brush with some butter. Ensure it is cooked through on both the sides well.
---

8. Smear some butter on top and serve naan right away with paneer butter masala, dal makhani, butter chicken or any other curry.
