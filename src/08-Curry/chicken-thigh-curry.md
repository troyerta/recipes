# Chicken Thigh Curry

## Ingredients

- 2 Onions, quartered
- 5 garlic cloves
- Ginger, "a good bit"
- Coriander seeds
- fennel seeds
- cumin seeds
- cinnamon stick(s)
- oil
- chilli peppers
- fenugreek
- garam masala
- tumeric
- asafoetida
- chicken thighs
- 1/2 pint chicken stock
- 1 can diced tomatoes
- Cilantro, chopped
- curry leaves

## Method

1. put two onions, 5 garlic clove and a good bit of ginger in a blender and blitz. Set aside
---
2. in the meantime, grind some coriander seeds, fennel seeds, and cumin seeds into a fine powder. Add the seeds and a cinnamon stick to a pan with some hot oil and wait for the aromas to release
---
3. whilst you're doing this, chop however many chillies you're used to having.
---
4. add the chillies to the mix
---
5. at this point I add a good amount of fenugreek, garam masala, turmeric, and asafoetida.
---
6. fry the damn things until you think it's about right, then add the garlic / onion/ ginger paste thing you made before
---
7. wait until it changes colour, obviously stirring constantly so it doesn't stick
---
8. add however many boneless chicken thigh fillets as you think will work with what you've done previously and cook them until they're about half done
---
9. pour the stock over the chicken and let it reduce. Depending on how much time you have, you can either cover it and reduce heat, or leave it open and leave the heat high (low heat and covered is best IMO)
---
10. when it's about half reduced, pour in a can of chopped tomatoes in their own juice. Then cook until the sauce thickens (the chicken will be cooked fine by then), add some curry leaves and some chopped cilantro right before serving and serve with whatever side you've prepared alongside

## Notes

- One person said to use red onion, because while is rarely used in traditional indian cooking

- Another recommended adding coconut milk after you fry all of the spices (step 6) and let it reduce a little (alternatively, greek yogurt works too)
