# Apple Cider Fritters With Cider Glaze

## Overview

- Yield: 36 small fritters

## Ingredients

#### For the dough:
- 1 cup cider
- 1 cup water
- 1 1/2 tablespoons active dry yeast
- 1/2 cup granulated sugar
- 1/2 cup melted butter, cooled
- 6 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon kosher salt

#### For the apple filling:
- 1 cup apple cider
- 2 tablespoons lemon juice
- 1/2 tsp cinnamon
- 1/4 tsp freshly ground nutmeg
- pinch of salt
- 1 vanilla bean, split
- 3 tablespoons butter
- 6 granny smith apples (or other tart baking apple), peeled, cored and cut into 1/4-inch dice
- 2 quarts vegetable oil for frying

#### For the glaze:
- 2 1/2 cups powdered sugar
- 1/3 cup heavy cream
- 1/3 cup apple cider
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice
- 1/8 teaspoon sea salt
- Flakey sea salt or vanilla salt, to finish

## Method

#### Prepare the dough:

1. In the bowl of a stand mixer with the paddle attachment, add the cider, water, yeast, sugar and melted butter and combine.
---
2. Add 2 cups of flour. Once incorporated, add the salt and the rest of the flour.
---
3. Mix the dough together for 5 minutes on medium speed.
---
4. Cover the bowl with a clean kitchen towel and allow to rise until doubled, about 2 hours.
---
---
#### Prepare the apples:

1. In a large skillet, combine the apple cider, lemon juice, cinnamon, nutmeg, vanilla bean and butter.
---
2. Bring the mixture to a simmer over medium low heat and reduce the liquid by half until slightly thickened and syrupy.
---
3. Add half of the apples and cook until just softened, about 5 minutes. Transfer this mixture to a large bowl to cool, then add the remaining diced apples. Set aside until cooled to room temperature.
---
---
#### Assemble the donuts:

1. Add the oil to a large Dutch oven and set it on the stove over high heat.
---
2. While the oil climbs to 350°F, roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface until it’s roughly 8 x 11 inches.
---
3. Add 1/3 of the cooled apples to the right side of the dough, then fold the left side over the apples. Give the dough a turn so the opening is now at the bottom.
---
4. Roll out the dough again and repeat the process until all the apples have been used. This is a messy process and will require some pesky runaway apples to be tucked back into the dough. If at any point the dough seems reluctant to roll out, simply give it a 5 minute rest then return to a much more relaxed and manageable dough.
---
5. Once all the apples have been folded into the dough, roll it out one final time into a rectangle that is about 1/2-inch thick. Cut the fritters into rough 1 1/2 inch squares.
---
6. Let them rest for a few moments before frying them in small batches.
---
7. Take care to keep the oil at a consistent 350°F. Fry the fritter until deeply golden and cooked through, about 5 minutes, flipping them once, halfway through.
---
8. Remove the fritters — and any apples that have fallen out — with a slotted spoon or a Chinese spider. Let them cool briefly on a wire rack.
---
9. Continue frying in this way until all the fritters have been fried.
---
---
#### Prepare the glaze:

1. In a medium bowl, whisk together the powdered sugar, heavy cream, apple cider, lemon juice, and salt.
---
2. Drizzle the glaze over the fritters while they are still warm. Finish with flake salt if desired.
