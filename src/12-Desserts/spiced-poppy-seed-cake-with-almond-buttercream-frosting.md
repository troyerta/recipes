## Method

#### Make the Cake:

1. Preheat oven to  350.  Grease three 9" round cake pans with shortening; line the bottoms with parchment.
---

2. Sift the flours, baking powder, cornstarch, nutmeg, cinnamon, and cardamom together.  Set aside.
---

3. With the whisk attachment of a stand mixer, whip the egg whites with the cream of tartar on high speed until soft peaks form.  Set aside.
---

4. In another bowl, use the paddle attachment to cream together the butter, sugar, and honey until light and fluffy.  On low speed, add the egg yolks one at a time, beating after each addition.  Scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl and beat until the mixture is smooth and creamy.
---

5. In a bowl, combine the milk, vinegar, and almond extract. (Don't worry if it curdles.)
---

6. Add the dry mixture in three additions, alternating with the milk/vinegar mixture.  Mix lightly, between additions, just until combined.  Scrape down the sides and bottom of bowl as needed.
---

7. Fold in the poppy seeds, then fold in the whipped egg whites in three additions. (Re-whip the egg whites first if they have separated.)
---

8. Pour the batter into the prepared pans and bake for 30-40 minutes, or until done.  Cool in the pans for 10 minutes, then remove to wire cooling racks.  Once the cakes are cool enough to handle, but still warm, wrap in plastic wrap, then in foil and freeze overnight, or until you're ready to frost.

10. The day you're going to frost the cake, take the layers out of the freezer and place in the refrigerator for several hours to defrost.
---

#### Make the Frosting:

1. Cream the butter and powdered sugar together using the paddle attachment of a stand mixer until it forms a thick "paste." Beat in the vanilla and almond extracts, then the half-and-half.  Beat until fully combined.  Add more half-and-half as needed to get to a fluffy consistency.  Beat until fluffy and no lumps remain.
---

2. With an offset spatula, spread a heaping 1/2 cup of frosting over each cake layer, then frost the top and sides.
---

3. Sprinkle on the poppy seeds and add a little piping detail with a large star tip, if desired.
---

4. Will keep covered at room temperature for 2 days, or refrigerated for about 1 week.
