# Homemade Tootsie Rolls

## Overview

- 1/4 cup powdered sugar, sifted

- 1 pinch salt

- 1 1/4 cups instant non-fat dry milk powder

2. Using a wooden spoon, mix in the instant milk powder 1/4 cup at a time until a dough forms. When you can no longer stir the mixture with a spoon, knead it with your hands. Keep adding in milk powder until a firm dough forms. You may not have to use all the milk powder. The finished dough should be firm and a little sticky but not so sticky that you canâ€™t handle it. Roll the dough into a ball and place on waxed paper lightly sprayed with cooking oil. Let dough rest uncovered on wax paper for 5 to 10 minutes. As the candy stands it will relax from a ball shape into a disc. Cut candy into 3/4-inch strips and then into 2-inch lengths. If candy sticks to the knife, spray it with cooking oil or coat it with butter.

3. Cut wax paper into 3 1/2 x 5 inch pieces. Wrap candies with the wax paper pieces. Store candies in an air-tight container in the refrigerator. Bring to room temperature before serving.
