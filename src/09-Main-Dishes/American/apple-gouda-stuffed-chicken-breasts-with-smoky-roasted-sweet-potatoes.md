# Apple Gouda Stuffed Chicken Breasts with Smoky Roasted Sweet Potatoes

## Overview

- Yield: 4

## Ingredients

#### For Chicken:

- 2 large boneless, skinless chicken breasts (mine were 10 ounces each – shoot for 4-6 ounces per serving)

- 1.5 ounces gouda cheese, thinly sliced

- 1/2 large apple, thinly sliced (I used Honeycrisp – any firm apple will work)

- 1 teaspoon olive oil for chicken

- 1 teaspoon fresh thyme, more as desired for garnish

- 1/2 teaspoon salt

- 1/2 fresh ground pepper

#### For Sweet Potatoes:

- 2 large sweet potatoes, peeled and diced

- 1 tablespoon olive oil

- 1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika

- 1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves

- 1/2 teaspoon sea salt

## Method

1. Preheat the oven to 425°F.
---

2. Spray a large baking dish or sheet pan with nonstick cooking spray. Split each chicken breast across but not through and open like a book (be careful, you can easily cut yourself doing this!). This is also known as butterflying.
---

3. On one side of the chicken, lay 7-8 thin apple slices followed by 4-5 slices of cheese. Sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon fresh thyme. Fold over and drizzle with 1/2 teaspoon olive oil. Sprinkle with 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper.

4. Place the chicken breast on sheet pan and top with another sprig of fresh thyme if desired.
---

5. In a bowl, mix diced sweet potatoes with olive oil, smoked paprika, 1 teaspoon thyme leaves and sea salt until evenly coated. Arrange sweet potatoes in a single layer around chicken breasts.
---

6. Bake for 20 minutes and then stir sweet potatoes.
---

7. Continue to bake until the juices run clear from chicken and internal temperature of chicken registers at 165 degrees, about 10 additional minutes. Sweet potatoes should be fork tender.
