## Ingredients

- 2 Onions

- 2 Large Carrots

- 750g Beef Mince

- 1 Tsp Nutmeg

- 2 Bay Leaves

- 1.5L Milk

- 500ml White Wine

- Olive Oil

## Method

1. To start making the ultimate ragú, finely dice your onions and celery and grate the carrots. Glug some olive oil into a large heavy-based pan and then pour in the veg and give it a good stir so that they are coated in olive oil. Add a good pinch of salt and allow the veg to cook slowly until they are super soft and transparent.

2. Once the onions, celery, and carrots have been sweated, whack the mince in and break it up into small pieces of meat.
---

3. Once the meat starts to brown, add in the nutmeg and bay leaves and allow it to cook for about 5 minutes.
---

4. Once the meat is brown all over pour in 500ml of milk into the pan and stir. Milk is the secret ingredient to making your ragú creamy and removing any acidity. Allow the milk to simmer away in the pan, this might take up to 30 minutes but be patient, it’s worth it!
---

5. Once the milk has nearly evaporated away you can add in the white wine. Make sure all the meat is covered by liquid, you can always top it up with water if need be. Turn up the heat slightly and simmer.
---

6. Once the wine has evaporated just passed halfway, add in the two tins of tomato, stir and season well then allow it to simmer for at least an hour. The longer you leave it the better the flavour will get. But be careful to keep an eye on it as you don’t want all the liquid to evaporate!
---

7. As the ragú simmers away its time to start on the white sauce. We need to make a roux which is the base to our sauce and is made up of the flour and butter. Add the butter into a large saucepan and allow it to melt down. Before it starts to pick up colour add in the flour and mix to form a paste.
---

8. Allow the roux to cook for 1 minute and then slowly add in the remaining milk bit by bit while constantly stirring to ensure it doesn’t go lumpy. Once all the milk has been mixed in, add 150g of grated parmesan into the sauce and then season it well.
---

9. Preheat the oven to 180°C.
---

10. Time to assemble the ultimate lasagne. Make sure you have a deep dish then the first layer of will be a light layer of white sauce, then the lasagne sheets so that the pasta doesn’t stick to the dish. Add a layer of ragú on top of the pasta, then a layer of the white sauce and then close the layer with more lasagne sheets. Repeat until the last layer.
---

11. For the last layer, pour on the remaining white sauce and then put on the sliced mozzarella and parmesan to create the ultimate crispy cheesy coating.
---

12. Once the lasagne is assembled place into the oven for 30 minutes or until golden brown and crispy. Take it out the oven and allow it to sit for 15 minutes before cutting into it!
