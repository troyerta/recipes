# Crash Hot Sweet Potatoes

## Overview

- Yield: 4
- Prep Time: 30 mins
- Cook Time: 25 mins
- Total Time: 55 mins

## Ingredients

- 1 & ½ tablespoons light brown sugar

- ½ teaspoon kosher salt

- ½ teaspoon ground cumin

- ½ teaspoon New Mexico chili powder

- ½ teaspoon smoked sweet paprika

- ¼ teaspoon onion powder

- ¼ teaspoon chipotle chili powder

- ⅛ teaspoon granulated garlic

- 10 coarse grinds of black pepper

- 2 medium to large sweet potatoes

- 2 tablespoons melted butter

- 2 tablespoons olive oil

## Method

1. Set a 3 quart sauce pan of water with a teaspoon of kosher salt on a medium flame until it begins to simmer.
---

2. Oil a large baking sheet, or cover with parchment paper.
---

3. In a small bowl, mix together all of the dry spices, and set aside
---

4. Peel the sweet potatoes, and cut into 1 & ½ inch thick slices.
---

5. When the water is simmering, add the potato slices and cook for around 10 minutes, until the slices are getting a little soft.
---

6. Remove the slices to a cooling rack. You can leave them on the rack until they cool off and the outsides are dry, or if you are in a hurry, blot all of the moisture from the surface of the slices. This is important - they have to be dry on the outside or they won't get crispy.
---

7. Start the oven preheating to 400º
---

8. Lay the slices of sweet potato on the prepared pan, and use a water glass to gently compress each slice - you want them to flatten out and the edges should get kind of ruffly.
---

9. Mix the butter and oil together.
---

10. Using a pastry brush or the back of a spoon, spread a thin layer of the oil and butter mixture on each slice.
---

11. Sprinkle some of the spice mixture over each slice, and press onto the surface lightly so that it sticks to the potato slices.
---

12. Gently turn oven each slice, and repeat the oil/butter and dry spice application as you did on the first side.
---

13. Roast in the oven for about 15 minutes, until the bottom of the slices is getting caramelized and crispy.
---

14. Carefully flip over each slice and roast another 10 minutes or so, until both sides are crispy and the spice mixture has melted together and turned all nicely brown.
---

15. Serve immediately.
