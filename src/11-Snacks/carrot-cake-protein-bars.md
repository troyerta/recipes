# Carrot Cake Protein Bars

## Ingredients

- 2 Tbsp Ener-G Egg Replacer

- ½ cup warm water

- 2 ripe bananas, peeled and mashed

- ¼ cup maple syrup

- 2 Tbsp non-dairy milk

- 1 Tbsp pure vanilla extract

- ½ cup coconut flour

- ½ cup unflavored, vegan, gluten-free protein powder*

- ¼ cup ground or milled flaxseed

- 1 tsp ground cinnamon

- ½ tsp gluten-free baking soda

- ¼ tsp ground nutmeg

- ¼ tsp sea salt

- pinch of ground cloves

- ¾ cup shredded carrots

- ¼ cup raisins (optional)

- 2 Tbsp coconut butter, melted

## Method

1. Preheat oven to 375°F and line a baking sheet with a silicon baking mat or parchment paper. Set aside.
---
2. Mix egg replacer and warm water together thoroughly (until it starts to get kind of foamy). Combine “egg” mixture, mashed bananas, maple syrup, non-dairy milk and vanilla extract in a large bowl with a hand or stand mixer.
---
3. Whisk together dry ingredients in a small bowl. Once incorporated, add to the wet mixture and mix until smooth.
---
4. Add shredded carrots and raisins and mix until just incorporated. Allow mixture to sit for 1-2 minutes to thicken up.
---
5. Using about ⅓ cup of mixture per bar, form it into a ball, then roll it between your palms so it begins to lengthen a bit. Press the form onto prepared pan and shape into a bar, about ¼” to ½” thick.
---
6. Bake bars for 22-25 minutes, or until an inserted toothpick comes out clean. The bottoms of the bars should be golden and the tops should be cracking slightly.
