2. Slice the kernels from 3 ears of the corn off and add to a large bowl. Grill or broil the remaining 3 ears corn until lightly charred all over, then remove and let cool just enough to handle. Slice the cooked corn kernels off the cob and add to the bowl with the raw corn.

4. To the bowl with the corn, add the remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil, the remaining lime juice, honey, chili powder, paprika, jalapeño, and chives. Season with salt and pepper and toss to combine. Stir in the chives, basil, cilantro, and feta, if using.

5. Spoon the remaining avocado puree into the bottom of a serving bowl and top with the corn salad. Serve the salad as a side or as an app with chips for scooping.
