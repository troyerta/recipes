2. Katsu sauce time. Chop up your onions, carrots, garlic and your knob of ginger. You want to cut the onions and carrots into nice little cubes.

3. Add a good glug vegetable oil to a large pan. Fry the onions and carrots until soft and caramelised. At this point, add the garlic and the ginger. Fry for a further 3 minutes. Add the curry powder and chilli powder. Mix and then add 2 tbsp of the flour (gradually, so you donâ€™t get any lumps). Mix that in and pour in your chicken stock.

4. Next, add the soy sauce. Mix and allow to bubble down and thicken. You want to bubble the sauce for 5-10 minutes so the flavour from the onions and carrots infuses. If it gets too thick, just add a splash more water. Once the sauce is the perfect pouring consistency, remove it from the heat and pass it through a sieve. Set the sieved veg aside.

5. Place the remaining thick katsu sauce on the heat. Add your sweet chilli sauce, and mix everything together. Cover the sauce and set aside.

6. Chicken time. Take your chicken thighs. Dip them in the rest of your flour, coat them in your whisked egg and then roll them in the breadcrumbs. Heat a generous amount of oil in a frying pan and add the chicken thighs. You want to have the oil on a low to medium heat. Add your thighs. The trick here is to cook for 4-5 minutes each side. Remove from the heat once the chicken is cooked through and the breadcrumbs are golden brown.

7. Slice up the chicken and serve on a bed of rice with the katsu sauce poured over the top. Add a spoonful of your katsu veg on the side and tuck in!
