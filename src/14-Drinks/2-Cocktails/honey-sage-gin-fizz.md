- 3 ounces gin

- 1/2 â€“ 1 ounce honey sage syrup (1/2 C honey and water each, 5-6 fresh sage leaves)

- 1/2 ounce fresh lime juice

- 5 ounces club soda

- fresh sage leaves for garnish


## Method

1. Combine all syrup ingredients in a saucepan and bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Reduce heat to low and stir until it appears that all of the honey has dissolved.

2. Fill the glass with a few sage leaves and ice cubes, then add gin, 1/2 ounce of syrup and lime juice, stirring well. Pour in club soda, stirring a bit more, then taste and determine if the drink has enough sweetness. If not, add a bit more syrup.

## Notes

- You may want less gin to make a weaker drink.
