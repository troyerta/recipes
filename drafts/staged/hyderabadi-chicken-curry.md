4. Add a bit more ginger–garlic paste and keep tossing until the paste spreads evenly across the pot.

9. Serve hot, preferably with paati’s coconut rice.

## Notes

- (1) Curd is great for tenderising the chicken and is commonly used in various marinades. It breaks down (denatures) the proteins in the chicken, allowing for it to soak up moisture in the pockets they leave behind. It is also great as a flavour enhancer, and brings an overall mildness to the chicken, which tends to contrast well with the sharp and spicy flavours of curries.
