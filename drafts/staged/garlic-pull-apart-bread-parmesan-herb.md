- Total Time: 3 hrs

## Ingredients

#### Roasted Garlic:

- 2 heads of garlic

- 1 tablespoon olive oil

- 1/4 teaspoon salt

#### Bread:

- 2 3/4 cups all-purpose flour

- 1 teaspoon sugar

- 2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast

- 1/3 cup milk whole or 2%

- 1/4 cup unsalted butter

- 1/4 cup water

- 1 teaspoon dried basil

- 1 teaspoon garlic powder

- 2 large eggs

#### Filling:

- 6 tablespoons unsalted butter

- 1/2 cup finely grated parmesan cheese

## Method

#### Roasted Garlic:

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. To roast the garlic, slice off the top portion of the garlic head to reveal the cloves. Lightly rub back and forth to remove the paper and peel any excess paper off. Pour a bit of olive oil over each bulb. Wrap the bulbs tightly in foil and place in the oven. Roast for 45 to 60 minutes, until the cloves are caramely and golden. Let cool slightly.

2. Squeeze the cloves out into a bowl and add the salt. Mash the cloves and salt with a fork.

#### Bread:

1. In the bowl of your electric mixer, stir together 2 cups of the flour, sugar and yeast.

2. Place the milk and butter in a small saucepan and heat over low heat just until the butter melts. Remove from the stovetop and let sit for 2 to 3 minutes, then stir in the water. With the dough hook attached to your mixer, stir in the milk and butter mixture until combined. Add the basil, oregano, rosemary salt, garlic powder and the eggs – one at a time – beating well after each addition. The dough will be very sticky! Add the remaining 3/4 cup flour gradually, beating for another 2 to 3 minutes until the dough comes together again. It should still be sticky. Place it in a well oil bowl and cover with a towel. Let it rise in a warm place for 1 hour.
---
3. After one hour, punch the dough down and turn it out on a floured surface. Roll it into a large rectangle, about 12×20 inches if possible. Add the filling: brush the dough with the melted butter, gently spread the roasted garlic over the dough and sprinkle with the parmesan cheese. Use a pizza cutter to slice the dough into 5 strips from top to bottom – lengthwise. Stack the 5 strips together, then cut them into 6 sets of squares.

4. Brush a 9×5 loaf pan liberally with melted butter. Place the dough, cut side down, into the loaf pan, pressing it together. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place again for 45 minutes.
---
5. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Place the pan in the oven and bake the bread for 35 to 40 minutes, until the top is golden brown and set. Remove and let cool for 10 minutes, then gently turn the bread out onto a flat surface. Sprinkle with fresh herbs like basil, oregano and rosemary and give it an extra sprinkle of parmesan.
