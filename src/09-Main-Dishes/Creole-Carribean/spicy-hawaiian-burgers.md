# Spicy Hawaiian Burgers

## Ingredients

- 2 pounds ground chicken

- 6 pineapple rings (or equivalent slices, cut about 1/2" - 3/4" thick)

- 6 slices pepper jack cheese

- 6 whole wheat hamburger buns

- 1/4 cup low-sodium soy sauce

- 1 tsp smoked paprika

- 1 tsp chili powder

- 1/2 tsp seasoning salt (I use Lawry's)

- 1/2 tsp ground cumin

- 1 clove garlic, minced

## Method

1. Combine the ground chicken, soy sauce, 1/2 the paprika, 1/2 the chili powder, seasoning salt, cumin, and garlic. Lightly mix with your hands and divide into 6 even balls. Form patties, making them slightly thinner in the middle and sprinkle with remaining paprika and chili powder. Refrigerate about 30 minutes.

2. Preheat the grill to medium heat. Coat grates lightly with oil. Grill burgers over medium heat about 6 minutes per side. The burgers should flip easily when they are ready to turn, if they want to stick, give them another minute. Top with cheese for the last 1-2 minutes of cooking time to melt. Remove to a plate and cover with aluminum foil to rest. Grill buns if desired.

3. For the pineapple, if you are using rings, grill directly on the grates over medium heat. Carefully turn after 1-2 minutes. If you are using pineapple slices or chunks, thread onto skewers and grill skewers in the same fashion. Assemble burgers and enjoy.
