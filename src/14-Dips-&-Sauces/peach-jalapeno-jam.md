# Peach Jalapeno Jam

## Overview

- Yield: 6 pints

## Ingredients

- 3 ½ lbs peaches

- 2 medium jalapeno peppers

- 7 ½ cups sugar

- 1 pouch liquid pectin

- ¼ cup lemon juice

- 1 – 2 tablespoons butter

## Method

1. Prepare the jars and lids according to package directions. I do mine by cleaning my jars well and putting them in a pan with about 4 - 5 inches water. Bring water to a boil, then reduce to a simmer until the jars are needed.

2. Remove the skins from your peaches by putting them in a pan of boiling water. When water comes back to a boil, leave the peaches in 1 more minute. Drain pan and pour cold water over the peaches.

3. Slice the peaches into thin slices. Chop the jalapenos into tiny pieces. Put the peaches and jalapenos in a large pot. Add sugar and lemon juice. Bring peaches to a boil. Stir often. Cook until the peaches are tender (about 30 minutes) over medium heat. If mixture foams add a tablespoon of butter, add the second tablespoon if still the peach mixture foams.

4. When the peaches are tender, stir in the pectin. Stir in and boil for one minute.

5. Carefully put the hot jam into the prepared jars. Leave a 1/4 inch headspace. Make sure rims are clean (wipe with a wet clean rag to be sure). Then add the lids and screw rings.

6. Have ready a pan of boiling water that will cover the jars. Add the jars to the water. Follow the directions on the pectin package for water bath canning times.

7. Remove jars and put on a clean kitchen towel. Listen for the lids to pop. If they don't refrigerate those jars for 3 weeks.
