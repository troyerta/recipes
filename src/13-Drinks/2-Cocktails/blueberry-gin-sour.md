# Blueberry Gin Sour

## Overview

- Serves: 2

- Prep Time: 10 mins

- Total Time: 10 mins

## Ingredients

- 100 g | 3.5oz | 1 cup fresh or frozen and defrosted blueberries

- 2 Tbsp simple syrup or 1 Tbsp sugar

- 4 Tbsp fresh lemon juice from one large lemon

- 2 Tbsp egg white

- 100 ml | 1/3 cup + 1 Tbsp gin

- 2 dashes Angostura Bitters, optional

- lemon peel to serve


## Method

1. Put the blueberries, lemon juice, simple syrup (or sugar) in a glass or measuring jug and muddle.
---
2. Add the muddled blueberries into your shaker along with the gin, bitters and egg white and shake vigorously to foam up the egg white.
---
3. Add plenty of ice into your shaker and shake for 30 seconds.
---
4. Strain the cocktail into two rocks glasses filled with ice. Garnish with a slice of lemon peel.

## Notes

- If you want a really smooth cocktail, strain the muddled blueberries and extract the juice before adding to your shaker.

- For a reverse dry shake: Shake your cocktail with ice first. Strain the cocktail and discard the ice. Add the strained cocktail back into the shaker and shake again without any ice - this creates a more foamy 'head' on your drink.
