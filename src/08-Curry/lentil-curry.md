## Overview

- Yield: 5-6
- Prep Time: 5 mins
- Cook Time: 45 mins
- Total Time: 55 mins

## Ingredients

- 50g (3 tbsp) butter , unsalted (sub 2 tbsp neutral oil)

- 4 garlic cloves , finely minced (Note 1)

- 1.5 tbsp ginger , finely minced (Note 1)

- 1 onion , finely chopped (white, yellow, brown)

- 2 tbsp curry powder , mild or spicy (your choice!) (Note 2)

- 1/2 tsp tumeric powder

- 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper , optional

- 1 1/4 tsp salt

- 1/2 tsp black pepper

- 1 cup dried lentils , green or brown (or any other dried lentils or split peas, Note 3)

- 400 ml / 14 oz coconut milk , full fat

- 400g/ 14 oz canned tomato , crushed or diced

- 3 cups (750 ml) water

#### Serving:

- 1/2 cup coriander/cilantro , finely chopped

- Yogurt , optional

- Basmati rice (or other rice)

## Method

1. Saute onion: Melt butter in a pot over medium heat. Add onion, garlic and ginger. Slowly cook, stirring every now and then, for 10 minutes until tinged with gold and the onion is sweet.
---

2. Cook off spices: Turn heat up to high, add curry powder and turmeric, stir for 1 1/2 minutes.
---

3. Add everything else: Add remaining ingredients and stir. Bring to simmer, then place lid on and adjust heat to low / medium low so it's simmering gently.
---

4. Simmer: Simmer for 30 minutes, then remove lid and simmer for a further 10 minutes to reduce the sauce. {Note 2 for cook times of other lentils}
---

5. Lentils should be soft, sauce should be thickened and creamy. Too thick, add water. Too thin, simmer with lid off - thickens quickly.
---

6. Coriander: Stir through half the coriander, then taste and add more salt if needed.
---

7. Serve over basmati rice, sprinkled with more coriander and a dollop of yogurt. (Low carb option - cauliflower rice).

## Notes

- Garlic and ginger - while fresh is ideal (followed by jarred), powder is a sufficient substitute - use 1 tsp of each and add with curry powder.

- Curry powder - I use Clives of India, Keens, and a generic brand and all tasted the same. The beauty of this recipe is that you don't need any fancy curry powder, just your run-of-the-mill jar from the grocery store.

- Lentils - use any dried lentils or canned here, or split peas (will result in an an interesting colour in your pot, but it will still be phenomenally delicious!)

- COOK TIMES:

- Green and brown lentils - most common & cheapest, cook per recipe

- Canned lentils (2 cans drained) - 25 min, uncovered the whole time

- Red split lentils - 25 min, uncovered the whole time

- Yellow or green split peas - 25 min, uncovered the whole time

- Any dal (Indian lentils) such as channa dal, toor dal or moong dal - per recipe

- French lentils (Puy lentils / black lentils)  - not recommended as they don't soften as well as other lentils so you won't get the same creamy, thick texture.

- Storage - will keep in fridge for up to 5 days, and in freezer for 3 months (thaw, heat, give it a good stir and it will be as good as new. Use water to thin slightly if needed.)
