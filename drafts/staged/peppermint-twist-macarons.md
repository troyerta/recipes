- Cook Time: 10 mins
- Total Time: 25 mins

## Ingredients

#### Cookies:

- 1 cup caster sugar*

- 3/4 cup almond flour

- 2 egg whites , room temperature

- pinch cream of tartar

- 1/4 cup granulated sugar

#### Filling:

- 1/4 cup butter , softened

## Method

1. In food processor or blender, pulse powdered sugar and almond flour for one minute, scraping down sides, until well blended and mixture starts to cling together.

2. Transfer to a sifter, sift into a small bowl. Repeat again, set aside.
---

3. In the bowl of a stand mixer or a large metal mixing bowl, whip egg whites until white and frothy. Add pinch of cream of tartar and continue to whip until mixture has increased in size.
---

4. Continue to whip and add granulated sugar, continue whipping for 5 minutes or until mixture is stiff and peaks form and stand on their own without falling.
---

5. At this point, sift almond flour mixture for a third time directly into the meringue base. Fold by hand and gently. Do not use the electric mixer or you risk losing the air you created by whipping them.
---

6. Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Prepare a large pastry/frosting bag with a ¾ inch round tip and fill with meringue. Pipe 1 ½ rounds to a parchment paper lined baking sheet. Attempt to whip the tip around and prevent little nubs on the tops. I don’t always do such a good job of this- but then again, they still look pretty!
---

7. Tap baking sheet several times on the counter to get air bubbles out. Allow to sit at room temperature for 5 minutes.
---

8. At the same time that you place your cookies into the oven, reduce heat to 325 degrees. Bake for 10-12 minutes or until meringues are crispy on the outside and baked into the classic meringue shape with a little ridge along the bottom.
---

9. Remove and allow to cool for 10 minutes before removing from baking sheet. Macarons should easily twist off parchment paper, but if not, spray water between parchment paper and baking sheet, the steam will release the cookies.
---

10. Allow to cool fully before attempting to sandwich.
---

11. Make frosting by combining softened butter, powdered sugar and vanilla extract. Add milk, 1 teaspoon at a time, until frosting is a spreadable consistency. Leave at room temperature until ready to assemble.
---

12. Pair cookies with a similar size with a heaping teaspoon of frosting between each. Make sure you have enough in the center that frosting oozes out the side; this will be what candy canes crumbles will stick to.
---

13. Spread crushed candy canes on a plate or in a shallow bowl. Roll sides of macarons in crumbles, allowing them to stick to center frosting.
---

14. Store peppermint twist macarons in refrigerator.
