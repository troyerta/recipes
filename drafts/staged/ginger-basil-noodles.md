3. Get a wok over a medium heat and pour in a glug vegetable oil. Add the ginger and spring onions (saving a few for garnish) and fry for 2-3 minutes until they lightly colour, then scrape in the garlic. Cook for 2 more minutes.

4. In another pan, boil your water and add the stock cube. Once dissolved add your noodles and cook until soft, according to packet instructions.

6. In the leftover noodle water, boil your eggs for 5 minutes then remove and place in cold water to stop them from cooking and help to remove the outer shells.

7. Youâ€™re now ready to plate up. Dish your noodles into four bowls, peel your eggs and place them on top. Finally, add a drizzle of chilli oil, your remaining basil and spring onions then tuck in!
