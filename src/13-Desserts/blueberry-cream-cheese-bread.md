## Ingredients

#### Bread:

- ½ cups Butter

- ½ cups Sugar

- ¼ teaspoons Salt

- 1 teaspoon Vanilla Extract

- 2 whole Egg Yolks

- 1-½ cup All-pupose Flour

- ¼ cups White Sugar

#### Filling:

- 8 ounces, weight Cream Cheese

- ½ cups Sugar

- 1 Tablespoon Flour

- 1 whole Egg

- 1 Tablespoon Orange Zest

#### Glaze:

- 2 Tablespoons Sugar

- ½ teaspoons Vanilla

- 1 teaspoon Water

#### Bread:

1. Cream butter and sugar (1/2 cup) until fluffy. Add salt and vanilla. Add egg yolks (save the egg whites as you’ll need them later) to the sugar mixture; beat until creamy. Set aside.
---
2. In another bowl, combine flour (1 1/2 cups) and baking powder. Add this mixture, alternately with milk to egg yolk mixture.
---
3. Coat berries with 1 tablespoon flour and add them to the batter.
---
4. In a separate bowl, beat egg whites until soft peaks form. Add sugar (1/4 cup), 1 tablespoon at a time, and beat until stiff peaks form. Fold egg whites into batter.
---
5. Pour 1/2 of the batter (or a little less) into a floured and greased bread pan. Layer the filling over the batter and then finish with remainder of batter. This will create a layer of “cheesecake” between the blueberry batter.
---
6. Pour glaze over top of unbaked loaf and bake at 350F for 55-60 minutes.
