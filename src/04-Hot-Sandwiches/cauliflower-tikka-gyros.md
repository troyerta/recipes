# Cauliflower Tikka Gyros

## Overview

- Total Time: 40 mins

## Ingredients

- 2 Cauliflowers

- 4 Pita Breads

- Cinnamon

- Turmeric

- Ground Coriander

- Chilli Powder

- 1 Cucumber (Grated)

- 6 Tomatoes (Roughly chopped)

- 2 Red Onions

- Bunch of Mint

- Bunch of Cilantro

- 1 Lemon

- 1 Pot of Alpro Unsweetened (I think it's like yogurt)

## Method

Preheat oven to 350°F.

Break the cauliflower into florets and cut into strips. Place cauliflower strips into a bowl. Add a teaspoon of turmeric, 2 teaspoons of chilli powder, 2 teaspoons of ground coriander and 1/2 a teaspoon of cinnamon. Season with salt and pepper and mix everything together.

Heat a griddle pan. Once very hot, add your cauliflowers in batches. Cook on a high heat for 3-4 minutes each side until charred. Place the chargrilled cauliflower in the oven for 10—12 minutes just so they can cook through.

Slice up red onions. Squeeze the juice of a lemon over them. Season with salt. Leave for 10 minutes to pickle.

For your Raita, add your cucumber, 8 tablespoons of yogurt, a handful of chopped mint, a handful of chopped cilantro, salt, pepper and olive oil. Mix everything together.

Take your pita bread, cut it open and place the cauliflower tikka in the pocket and drizzle some raita over the top. Add your pickled onions, some chopped tomatoes, more raita and tuck in.
