# Baked Lemon Poppy Seed Donuts and Blueberry Glaze

Oven-baked lemon poppy seed donuts

## Overview

- Yield: 6 donuts
- Cook Time: 10 minutes

## Ingredients

#### Lemon Poppy Seed Donuts:

- 1 cup all-purpose flour

- 1 teaspoon baking powder

- 1/4 teaspoon baking soda

- 1/2 teaspoon salt

- 2 tablespoons poppy seeds

- 1/2 cup almond milk, room temperature

- 1 1/2 teaspoons apple cider vinegar

- 1/3 cup granulated sugar

- 2 teaspoons lemon zest

- 3 tablespoons coconut oil, melted & slightly cooled

- 1 tablespoon freshly-squeezed lemon juice

- 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract

#### Blueberry Lemon Glaze:

- 1/2 cup blueberries (fresh or frozen)

- 2 teaspoons freshly-squeezed lemon juice

- approx. 3/4 cup powdered sugar (more or less to taste)

## Method

#### Lemon Poppy Seed Donuts:

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit and generously spray a donut pan with nonstick cooking spray.
---
2. Whisk together the dry ingredients in a medium-size bowl (flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and poppy seeds).
---
3. In a glass measuring cup, combine the milk and apple cider vinegar and set aside.
---
4. In a large bowl, combine the granulated sugar and lemon zest. Using your fingers, incorporate them together completely. Whisk in the coconut oil, then add the lemon juice, milk/vinegar mixture, and vanilla extract. Whisk until combined.
---
5. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet, folding to combine with a rubber spatula or wooden spoon. Divide the batter evenly among the molds in your prepared donut pan, filling each mold about 3/4 of the way full (don't overfill, or you'll lose the hole in the center of your donut!).
---
6. Bake at 350 degrees for 10-12 minutes, until golden brown on the edges. You can use a toothpick to check for doneness, or gently press on the top of one of the donuts with your finger. If it (slowly) springs back, it's done! Let the donuts cool in the pan for about 10 minutes, then transfer each donut to a wire rack. Allow to cool completely before glazing.

#### Lemon Blueberry Glaze:

1. Combine the blueberries and lemon juice in a small skillet over medium-low heat and simmer until the juices are released and the blueberries have broken down.
---
2. Remove from heat and press the fruit through a metal sieve placed over a small bowl to strain the juice. Discard the seeds and skins.
---
3. Let the juice cool down, then whisk in the powdered sugar gradually. You can add more or less than 3/4 cup of powdered sugar until the desired taste and consistency is reached. This will depend on how much juice your berries released and how thick/sweet you prefer your glaze.
---
4. Place a cookie sheet under your cooling rack (to catch any glaze drips), then dip the donuts one by one (upside down) in the glaze. Let the excess glaze drip off, then replace the donut on the cooling rack to allow the glaze to set slightly.
---
5. Donuts are best when served immediately.
---

## Notes

- It's recommended to glaze the donuts immediately before, or within two hours of serving. You can keep the donuts for another day if necessary, but the glaze will soak somewhat into the donuts.

- For a pop of (all-natural) color, homemade blueberry juice makes the most gorgeous lemon blueberry glaze.
