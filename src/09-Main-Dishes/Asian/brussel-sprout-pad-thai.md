## Overview

- Yield: 4 servings

- Total Time: 30 mins

## Ingredients

- 500g Brussel Sprouts

- 225g Block of Smoked Tofu

- 1 Lime

- 2 Cloves of Garlic

- 2 Tbsp Tamarind Paste

- 3 Tbsp Soy Sauce

- 2 Tbsp Soft Brown Sugar

- 400g Wide Flat Rice Noodles

- 2 Tbsp Chilli Oil With Sediment (we used Lee Kum Kee)

- 200g Beansprouts

- Handful Salted Roasted Peanuts

1. Trim the bases off the brussel sprouts and cut them in half. Cut the tofu into roughly 1cm squares. Cut the lime into four wedges. Finely chop the garlic cloves.

2. For the sauce, mix together the tamarind, soy and soft brown sugar. Set aside.

3. Soak the rice noodles in a large bowl full of hot water for 10 minutes.
---
4. While the noodles are soaking, get a wok or large frying pan over a high heat. Pour in some vegetable oil. Add the sprouts. Stir fry for 3-4 minutes until beginning to soften and lightly colour then scrape in the garlic. Cook for 1 minute more.

5. Scrape the brussels and garlic to one side of the pan. Pour in a splash more oil and add the tofu. Fry for 2-3 minutes until beginning to crisp then turn the heat to the lowest whilst you drain the noodles.
---
6. Get the pan back on the heat, tip in the drained noodles along with a splash of water. Give everything a good mix, fry for 2 minutes then pour in the sauce. Cook for a further 2 minutes until the noodles are soft enough to eat then add the beansprouts, chilli oil, and most of the peanuts to the pan.
---
7. Give everything one last toss then dish the Pad Thai into bowls. Top with the remaining peanuts and some torn cilantro.

## Notes

- Make sure you let the sprouts char a bit to improve flavor
