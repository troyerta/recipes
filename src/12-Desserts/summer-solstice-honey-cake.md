5. Place cake mold on cookie sheet for support during baking.   Pour batter into greased cake mold and put in preheated oven.

6. Watch it!  Honey caramelizes a lot faster than sugar.  Bake until you can plunge a fork into the cake and it comes out clean.

7. Allow to cool for at least 1.5 hours before removing.  Remove carefully from mold by placing another cookie sheet on the “cake side” of the mold and then flipping both cookies over.  Gently pull off the mold and see how you did!!
