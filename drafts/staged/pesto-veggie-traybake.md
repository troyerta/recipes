2. Pesto time. Add a large handful of fresh basil to a food processor with 8 tbsp of olive oil. Finely grate your parmesan and add it to the food processor with 2 cloves of peeled garlic, 15g of pine nuts and a pinch of salt. Blend until you achieve a creamy pesto consistency, season to taste and set aside for later.

3. Slice your peppers, onion and courgette. Slice your aubergine and cut each slice into quarters. Add the veg to a large bowl and sprinkle with oregano, fennel seeds, chilli flakes and a big pinch of salt and pepper. Mix through until the vegetables are coated in seasoning.

4. Spread your veg out onto two baking trays. Keep the cherry tomatoes on the vine and add to both trays. Whack in the oven for 25 minutes.

5. Crouton time. Chop your ciabatta into bite-sized chunks and add to a large bowl. Add a good drizzle of olive oil over the bread. Crush your garlic and chop a handful of parsley and add it to the bowl. Give it a good mix so that the garlic and parsley fully coat each piece of ciabatta. Season with a pinch of salt and a grind of pepper.

6. Remove your trays from the oven and spread your garlic croutons onto each tray. Tear and add your mozzarella in the same way. Spoon your pesto evenly over each tray and bake for 10 minutes until the mozzarella is melted. Sprinkle the remaining pine nuts over both trays and bake for 5 minutes.

7. Add a final drizzle of olive oil to each traybake and dig in!
