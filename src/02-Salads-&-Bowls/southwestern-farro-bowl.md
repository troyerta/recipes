#### For the Sweet Potatoes:

- 2 medium sweet potatoes peeled and cut into 1/4" cubes

- olive oil

- 1/2 Tablespoon ground chipotle powder

#### For the Bowl:

- 3 cups cooked farro

- 1 bag frozen corn thawed

- 1 can low-sodium black beans drained and rinsed

- 1/4 small red onion diced

- 1 medium avocado pitted and sliced (or cubed if you prefer)

#### For the Dressing:

- 1/2 cup tahini

- 2/3 cup freshly squeezed lime juice

- 2/3 cup fresh cilantro tightly packed, stems OK

- 1/4 teaspoon sea salt

- 1 teaspoon maple syrup

- 1 teaspoon lime zest

- 1 Tablespoon olive oil

- 1 - 3 Tablespoons water to reach desired consistency

## Method

#### For the Sweet Potatoes:

1. Preheat oven to 425.
---
2. Spread diced sweet potatoes in a single layer on a foil lined baking sheet.
---
3. Drizzle with enough olive oil to coat. Sprinkle with chipotle powder. Then, using your hands, mix it all around on the sheet until all the potatoes are evenly coated with the oil and chipotle.
---
4. Roast at 425 for approximately 20 minutes. This is the reason I dice the sweet potatoes so small. They roast quicker. Ovens vary so keep an eye that they don't burn.
---
5. While the potatoes are roasting make the dressing.
---

#### For the Dressing:

1. Place all ingredients, except the water, in a blender and blend until smooth.
---
2. If necessary, add water little by little to reach desired consitency.
---

#### Assemble the Bowl:

1. Add all ingredients to a large bowl and toss. You may not use all the corn and beans. Adjust to your taste.
---
2. Serve dressing on the side.
