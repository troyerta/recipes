# Balsamic and Herb Steak Marinade

## Overview

- Yield: 1 Cup
- Prep Time: 5 mins
- Cook Time: 10 mins
- Total Time: 15 mins

## Ingredients

- 1/3 cup balsamic vinegar

- 3 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce (or tamari)

- 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce

- 2 tablespoons finely-chopped fresh rosemary

- 2 tablespoons olive oil

- 2 teaspoons Dijon mustard

- 1 teaspoon each: garlic powder and freshly-cracked black pepper

- 1/2 teaspoon onion powder

## Method

1. Whisk together the ingredients for (one) marinade in a small bowl until combined.
---
2. Combine marinade with steak in a ziplock freezer bag, and toss until the steak is evenly coated in the marinade.  Carefully press out any extra air that might be in the bag, then seal.  (You will need 1/3 cup marinade per 1 pound of steak.)
---
3. If using immediately: refrigerate the steak pack(s) for anywhere from 30 minutes to up to 1 day.
---
4. If freezing: immediately transfer the steak pack(s) to the freezer, and freeze for up to 3 months.  Then when youâ€™re ready to cook the steak, transfer the steak pack back to the refrigerator for 24 hours, or until it has thawed completely.  Or to speed up the process, you can submerge the sealed steak pack in a bowl of cold water in the refrigerator until it has thawed completely.
---
5. When ready to cook, remove the steak from the marinade, discard the remaining marinade, and let the steak rest on a plate for 20 minutes at room temperature.  (This will help it cook more evenly.)  Cook however you prefer.
