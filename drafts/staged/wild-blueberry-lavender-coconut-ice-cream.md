2. After mixture comes to a slight simmer, whisk once more, then transfer to a blender, add in lavender and vanilla and blend for 30 seconds. Allow to cool for a few minutes, then transfer to a large bowl, cover and refrigerate for 4 hours until very cold. This is an essential step, so please do not skip it!

3. While the mixture is chilling, you'll make a blueberry syrup. Add blueberries and coconut sugar to a saucepan and place over medium heat. Mash blueberries up with a fork and continue to stir mixture until it thickens; this should take roughly 15-20 minutes. Once mixture is thick like a syrup, transfer to a bowl, cover and stick in the fridge.

5. Transfer half of ice cream to a freezer safe container, then add half of the blueberry mixture, repeat with ice cream and blueberries once more. Swirl mixture a few times with a knife to create layers. Cover ice cream and freeze for 4-6 hours or until ice cream hardens.
