2. In a separate bowl, combine cooked shredded chicken, hot sauce, ranch dressing and minced garlic then stir until the chicken is well coated.

3. Take your slices of bread and spread a layer of butter on one side of each slice of bread. Turn the bread over and spread the cheese mixture on four of the bread slices (one for each sandwich) then top with the chicken mixture. Try to distribute an even amount between all four sandwiches. It should be about 1/2 a cup for each one. On the other slice of bread place a slice or two of your favorite sliced cheese and close the sandwich.

4. Spray a large skillet with cooking spray and cook the sandwiches on low heat for 5 minutes or until the bread is golden and crispy. Flip and repeat on the opposite side. Depending on the size of your fan you may need to grill the sandwiches in separate batches. Once finished remove from the pan and enjoy with additional buffalo sauce, ranch or blue cheese dressing.
