# Homemade Peppermint Patties

## Overview

- Yield: 50 patties

## Ingredients

- 7 1/2 cups powdered sugar, sifted

- 1/3 cup evaporated milk

- 1/3 cup light corn syrup

- 3 tablespoons extra-virgin or refined coconut oil

- 1/4 teaspoon food-grade peppermint essential oil or 1 teaspoon peppermint extract (see note)

- 1 1/2 pounds bittersweet or semisweet baking chocolate, chopped

- Crushed peppermint candies for sprinkling, optional

## Method

1. In a large mixing bowl, beat together the sugar, milk, corn syrup, coconut oil and peppermint on low speed until combined. Shape the dough into two round circles, cover in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes.

2. Sprinkle a liberal amount of powdered sugar on a clean countertop or on a piece of parchment paper. Unwrap one disk of dough and place it on the counter or parchment. Sprinkle the top with powdered sugar, too. Roll the peppermint patty dough to about 1/4-inch thick and cut into rounds with about a 1 7/8-inch or similar-sized cutter.
---

3. Reroll the scraps until all of the dough is used. Repeat with second disk of dough. Place the rounds on a parchment-lined baking sheet and freeze until firm, about 30 minutes or overnight.

4. Melt the chocolate (I use the microwave on 50% power and cook for 1-minute increments, stirring in between; I melt until it is mostly melted but there are still a few small lumps of chocolate - I stir these in until fully melted. This will help to avoid blooming on the set chocolate.)
---

5. Using a fork, dip the frozen patty rounds one-by-one into the chocolate. Tap the handle of the fork on the side of the bowl to drizzle off the excess chocolate, scrape the bottom of the fork on the edge of the bowl and gently place the dipped patties on parchment-lined baking sheets using a butter knife to gently slide the patty off the fork if needed.
---

6. Sprinkle the dipped patties with crushed mints, if using. Let the chocolate set, about an hour. Store patties in the refrigerator.

## Notes

- The recipe calls for either food-grade peppermint essential oil or mint extract. In either case, you'll want to add more of either if needed - so taste the filling before rolling, cutting and dipping. I used about 1/4 teaspoon peppermint oil initially but ended up adding a few more drops for a more potent peppermint taste. I haven't tried this yet but I think it would be absolutely delightful to add a touch of peppermint to the chocolate, too.

- Here's a quick video tip on tempering/melting chocolate and another on dipping things in chocolate like a pro.

- FYI: My preferred brand of chocolate is Ghirardelli.
