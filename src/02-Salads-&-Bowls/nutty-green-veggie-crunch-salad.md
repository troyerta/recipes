# Nutty Green Veggie Crunch Salad

## Overview

- Yield: 4 servings
- Prep Time: 30 mins
- Total Time: 30 mins

## Ingredients

#### Salad

- 1/2 large head romaine, washed, patted dry, and shredded

- 1/2 to 3/4 large head green cabbage, cored and shredded

- 2–3 mini cucumbers, thinly sliced

- 1 bunch scallions, ends trimmed and thinly sliced

- 1/2 to 1 bunch cilantro, stemmed and finely chopped

- 1 cup shelled edamame*

- 1/2 cup chopped peanuts, almonds, or sunflower seeds (or a mix of all three—my favorite), plus more for topping

- 2 tablespoons sesame seeds (optional)

#### Nutty Sesame Dressing

- 3 tablespoons creamy peanut butter, almond butter, or sunflower butter

- 1 1/2 tablespoons pure maple syrup

- 1 1/2 tablespoons tamari**

- 1 1/2 tablespoons rice vinegar

- 1 1/2 tablespoons toasted sesame oil

## Method

1. For the salad: Add all salad ingredients to a large serving bowl.
---
2. For the dressing: In a medium mixing bowl, vigorously whisk together all dressing ingredients until completely smooth and emulsified.
---
3. Pour as much of the dressing over the salad as desired, and toss to coat.
---
4. Serve immediately and top with more nuts and seeds, if desired.

## Notes

*Use frozen shelled edamame. If you do this too, just be sure to thaw it before adding!

**Use regular Tamari. If you use reduced-sodium, you'll want to increase the amount (maybe to 2 tablespoons or so). Also, if you don't need to keep this salad gluten-free, you can substitute soy sauce for the tamari.
