Mix everything together and leave to marinate for 20 minutes (or longer if you have time).

2. Into a small bowl, add the remaining peanut butter, soy sauce and coconut milk. Finely chop the rest of the ginger and your chilli. Add this to the bowl and mix together until you have a creamy satay sauce.

3. Slaw time. Grate your cabbage and carrot into a large bowl. Finely chop your cilantro and mint and add this too. Slice up your mango and whack it in. Sprinkle a pinch of salt followed by your vinegar and mix everything together thoroughly.

4. Start toasting your pittas.

5. Once your chicken is marinated, add to a lightly oiled frying pan and stir until cooked through.

6. Assembly time! Take your pitta and cut it open. Start with the chicken and dollop some satay sauce over the top. Stuff the pitta with some of that crunchy slaw. Add some more satay sauce and top with a sprinkling of peanuts. Tuck into this delightful little pitta and enjoy.
