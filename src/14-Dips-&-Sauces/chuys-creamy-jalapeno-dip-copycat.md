# Chuys Creamy Jalapeno Dip Copycat

## Overview

- Total Time: 10 mins

## Ingredients

- 1 whole large jalapeno, chopped

- 2 cloves garlic, minced

- 3 tablespoons fresh cilantro

- 16 oz light sour cream

- 1 oz package of ranch dressing mix

- Â½ lime, juiced

- 4-6 tablespoons milk


## Method

1. Combine jalapeno, garlic, and cilantro in blender or food processor.
---
2. Pulse until finely chopped.
---
3. Add light sour cream, ranch dressing mix, and lime juice and pulse to combine.
---
4. Add milk and pulse. You can add it slowly to get the consistency you want. The Chuy's version is pretty thin, so I liked 6 tablespoons.
---
5. Refrigerate for a few hours to allow the flavors to combine, though it's pretty amazing right from the start, too.

## Notes

- You can leave out the jalapeno seeds if you want a milder version.
