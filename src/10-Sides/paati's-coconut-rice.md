## Notes

- (1) These are approximates for the measurement. My grandma has been cooking for over sixty years, so she’s transcended the need for measuring stuff, unlike us mere mortals. There may be light discrepancies, but I tried to be as exact as possible.

- (2) Mor milagais are fascinating little things and quite tedious to make at home. First, you must soak green chillies in mor, which is curd diluted in water. After soaking the chillies for about a day, you need to dry it out in the sun for about 10 days straight. Or, you could go down to the store and get a packet of it.

- (3) The rice should be cooked for about half an hour, and then quickly put into a wide-bottom bowl. This will allow it to cool and make it fluffy. If you leave it as it is, the heat will make the rice overcook and become sticky. To add to this, the rice is cooked in a rice cooker for about 30 minutes.

- (4) The coconut takes about 10 minutes to turn red. If it turns black, you’ve gone too far. Once you take it off the stove, it’ll become a dark brown.

- (5) If the pan begins to smoke, you need more oil.
