# Slow Cooker Chicken Tandoori

## Overview

A non-traditional recipe for Tandoori-style chicken without a Tandoori oven

## Tools

Slow Cooker

Searing torch

## Ingredients

2 lbs chicken - breast or thigh

### Marinade

1 cup Plain Yoghurt

1/2 Tbsp Coriander I've used both ground and dried before and both work well

2-3 Tbsp Lemon Juice - or 1/2 of a juiced lemon if fresh

1/2 Tbsp Cumin

1/2 Tbsp Cayenne Pepper to taste - look for "warmth" over "spicy"

1/2 Tbsp Turmeric

1.5 Tbsp Paprika (sweet preferred over spicy here)

1/2 Tbsp Smoked Paprika

1 Tbsp Tandoori masala

4 Cloves Garlic (crushed)

2 Tbsp Ginger (fresh or powder)

1/2 tsp salt

A splash of boiled water if marinade needs thinned

### Sauce

Water as needed to set consistency and flavor intensity

## Method

### Marinate the Chicken

Add yogurt and all spices to a tub/ bowl, and stir through until evenly mixed

---
Place chicken in marinade and leave for a least 4 hours - (ideally overnight)

### Prep for the Cooker: (if using chicken thighs)

Heat a pan with a spritz of oil

---
Place chicken thighs skin down and allow to sear about 4-5 minutes

---
Flip over and repeat

### Add to Slow Cooker

Pop all chicken into slow cooker. Thighs will take longer than breast. Cook until chicken cuts with a fork.

### Finishing

Blow torch for a few minutes to char. This is the "Tandoori" style finish. A grill works for this too.

## Serve

With basmati rice and naan
