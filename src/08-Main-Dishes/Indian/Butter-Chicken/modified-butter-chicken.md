#### Hour-of Meal Prep:

2. Pre-heat the oven to 425 deg F. Then go to step 3. When heated, array the chicken thighs across a grilling rack, and broil for ~10mins on each side, around 6 inches from the grill. Broil until good color has developed one at least one side of each thigh. Once cooked, cool on the side for 10 mins. Add bite-sized pieces to sauce when ready.

3. Wash rice and start cooking. ~1 cup of dry grains per lb. of chicken.
---

4. Dice all the sauce veggies.
---

5. Gather all the sauce spices together into one bowl - except for salt and sugar.
---

6. Start the sauce. Cook the diced sauce veggies in 2 Tbsp of butter for 10 mins. Onion should be softened and colored.
---

7. Add the spice mixture, cook for 30 secs - 2 mins, depending on applied heat. Wake up the spices without burning them.
---

8. Add the water, tomato paste, salt, sugar, and bring to a simmer.
---

9. Turn off heat, and stir in heavy cream.
---

10. Blend it. However you do it best.
---

11. Add the grilled chicken. Return to a simmer.
---

12. Rest the butter chicken: Turn off the heat and uncover the pan.
---

13. Stir in the remaining 1/2 tablespoon butter and the kasuri methi.
---

14. Cover again, and let the dish rest for 8 to 10 minutes so the flavor of kasuri methi can marry into the butter chicken.

## Notes

- Serve with a side of steamed basmati rice, roti, or naan. Leftovers will keep refrigerated, covered, for 5 days.

- You can freeze this dish in an airtight covered container or a zip-top bag for a month. Thaw and reheat in a saucepan over medium-low heat to retain the texture.
