# Cream Cheese Danishes

## Overview

- Yield: 24 pastries

## Ingredients

- 2 cans Pillsbury Grands Crescent Rolls (big & flaky)

- 1 can pie filling (I like cherry)

- 8 oz cream cheese

- 1 tsp vanilla

- 1/3 cup sugar

- Powdered sugar

- Milk

## Method

1. Place crescent roll cans in the freezer for about 30 minutes.
---
2. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit and line baking sheets with silicon mats or parchment paper.
---
3. Beat cream cheese, vanilla and sugar with an electric mixer until smooth and fluffy.
---
4. Open the cans and slice each into 12 pieces, approximately 1/2″ slices. (Don’t unroll them, pretend they’re slice and bake cookies.)
---
5. Easy Cream Cheese DanishesPlace six slices on a cookie sheet, flattening the centers to create an indent. (I used a large spice container dipped in flour, plus my fingers for a little extra flattening in the middle.)2
---
6. Fill the indent half with the cream cheese mixture and half with the pie filling.
---
7. Bake until edges are golden brown, about 15 minutes.
---
8. Cool completely on a wire rack.
---
9. In a small bowl, mix a large spoonful of powdered sugar with a little milk until liquid but still thick. Spoon into a pastry bag or Ziploc, cut off the tip, and drizzle over the pastries.
---
10. Enjoy one (or three, I don’t judge) with a cup of coffee or a tall glass of milk.

## Notes

- These spread a lot during baking, so don’t try to squeeze too many on a pan. Start with 6 and see if you have room for more after the first batch is baked.
