# Rich Italian Hot Chocolate

## Overview

- Yield: 2 - 4 servings

## Ingredients

- 1 cup whole milk, divided

- 1 cup heavy whipping cream

- 4 tablespoons (50g) granulated sugar

- 1½ teaspoons cornstarch (reduce to 3/4 teaspoon if a thinner consistency is preferred)

- 4½ ounces/ 128 grams dark chocolate, callets or finely chopped from a bar*

- Whipped cream, optional for garnish

- Chocolate shavings, optional for garnish

## Method

1. In a medium, heavy bottomed saucepan over medium-high heat, whisk together ¾ cup of the milk, cream and sugar. Heat, whisking occasionally, until the mixture starts to bubble around the edges.

2. Meanwhile, in a small bowl or liquid measuring cup with a spout, whisk together the remaining ¼ cup milk and cornstarch until well combined. As soon as the milk mixture bubbles around the edges, add in the milk and cornstarch mixture and whisk until heated through, about 1 minute.

3. Reduce heat to medium-low, then add in the chocolate and whisk until completely dissolved into the milk mixture, and is thick enough to coat a spoon, about 5 minutes.

4. Remove from heat and pour into mugs. While this recipe fills 2 average-sized mugs, keep in mind that it's super rich, so you might want to consider serving 4 half cupfuls instead. Garnish with a dollop of whipped cream and top with chocolate shavings if desired. Serve immediately as the drink will continue to thicken as it cools.

## Notes

- Chocolate with at least 55% cocoa and up to 75% is recommended in this recipe. Dark semisweet chocolate around 55% (my personal preference) will produce a sweeter drink that is more suitable for milk/semisweet chocolate lovers. I use this one. If you're a dark chocolate fan, then go with 62%-75% cocoa chocolate, as it for will make a less sweet, intensely chocolate-y drink.

- This recipe produces a super thick hot chocolate in the best way possible. The consistency is similar to a thin chocolate sauce and the texture is that of a lighter pudding, and it will continue to thicken as it cools. If a thinner, less rich hot chocolate is desired, feel free to reduce the cornstarch amount by half.
