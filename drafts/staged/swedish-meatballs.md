- Cook Time: 1 hr
- Total Time: 1 hr 30 mins

## Ingredients

#### Swedish Meatballs:

- 4 slices white bread, no crusts

- 1/2 cup heavy cream

- 2 tablespoons Land O Lakes® Butter, divided

- 1 small onion, chopped

- 4 cloves garlic, chopped

- 1 pound ground beef

- 1 pound ground pork

- 1 egg

- 2 tablespoons brown sugar

- 2 teaspoons salt (more to taste)

- a few shakes of black pepper

#### Gravy:

- 4 tablespoons Land O Lakes® Butter

- 1/4 cup flour

- 2 cups beef broth

- 8 ounces sour cream

- 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce (more to taste)

## Method

1. In a small bowl, soak the white bread in the heavy cream. Heat 1 tablespoon butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and the garlic; sauté for 5 minutes until softened. Add the soaked bread and the cooked onion / garlic mixture to the bowl of a food processor. Pulse for 10-15 seconds until mostly smooth.

2. Add your bread / garlic / onion mixture to a large bowl with the remaining meatball ingredients. Mix well. Roll into meatballs.

3. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add 1 tablespoon butter; sauté the meatballs in batches, turning occasionally, to get them browned on the outside (the inside doesn’t have to be cooked yet). Transfer browned meatballs to a pan, cover with foil, and bake for 30 minutes until cooked through.

4. Gravy time! Wipe the skillet out so it’s clean. Melt the butter. Whisk in the flour; sauté for 2-3 minutes. Add the beef broth, slowly, stirring after each addition. Gradually a smooth sauce should start to form. Stir in the sour cream and season with Worcestershire sauce and extra salt.

5. Put meatballs back in the gravy pan and let them get nice and coated. Serve over mashed potatoes, with a cucumber salad and cranberries.

## Notes

- You can use pan drippings to make your gravy, but the gravy will be more lumpy and flecked with meatball bits. I prefer a smooth gravy, which is why I like to wipe out the pan first and just start fresh with butter.

- The meatball mixture is WET! That’s normal. We want that because it makes for a very tender meatball once it’s cooked. If you get your hands slightly wet, you’ll have an easier time rolling them.

- If you are using thin, plain white sandwich bread, you may want to use 6-8 slices instead to make a thicker bread mixture.
