# Road Trip Energy Bar

## Overview

- Yield: Makes 8 bars

## Ingredients

- 1 ripe organic banana, mashed (try adding a second or third banana if you wish to make these sugar-free)

- 2 cups certified gluten-free rolled oats

- 1/4 cup gluten-free oat flour (or just process some gluten-free rolled oats into a fine powder)

- 1/2 cup mini chocolate chips, vegan + gluten-free

- 1/4 – 1/2 cup maple syrup (you could also use honey, coconut nectar, brown rice syrup, etc. – or skip and add extra bananas)

- 1/2 cup organic natural peanut butter, chunky or creamy (or any other nut or seed butter)

- 2 tablespoons organic baking cocoa

- 2 tablespoons chia seeds, (you could also use flax seeds, sunflower seeds, pepitas, etc)

- 1/4 cup almond slivers (or any other nut of your choice)

- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

- 1 – 2 tablespoons espresso powder (optional)

- 1/4 teaspoon sea salt

## Method

1. Preheat oven to 350º F. Grease an 8″ x 8″ glass baking pan very well, or line it with foil, leaving some overhang on two of the sides so you can easily pull it out of the pan to make cutting even easier (this is what I did).

2. In a large mixing bowl, add all of your ingredients. Mix and mash up very well until it is all well combined. Get your hands in there!

3. Press the mixture firmly and evenly into your pan. Place the pan into the oven and bake for 20-25 minutes. Don’t worry if the bars seem a bit soft, they will firm up as they cool. After it has completely cooled, either lift the entire thing out of the pan and cut into bars or squares, or cut while it is in the pan.

4. These can be stored individually in the fridge or freezer. Since I made these two days ago, I stored them in the fridge and then wrapped each one individually in a little piece of parchment paper and a sandwich bag for easy eating in the car!
