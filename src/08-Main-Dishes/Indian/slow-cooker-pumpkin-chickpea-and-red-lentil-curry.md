# Slow Cooker Pumpkin Chickpea & Red Lentil Curry

## Overview

- Yield: 4-6
- Prep Time: 10 mins
- Cook Time: 8 hrs
- Total Time: 8 hrs

## Ingredients

- 2 (15-ounce) cans chickpeas, drained

- 1 medium yellow onion, diced

- 2 medium cloves garlic, minced

- 2 cups low-sodium vegetable broth

- 1 cup split red lentils, rinsed

- 1 cup pumpkin puree

- 1 tablespoon curry powder*

- 1/4 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper

- 1 teaspoon kosher salt + more to taste

- 1 (15-ounce) can coconut milk (I use full-fat for this recipe; lite will probably still taste great but might result in a thinner curry)

#### For Serving:

- White rice, brown rice or cauliflower rice

- Fresh lime wedges

- Cilantro leaves

## Method

1. Add all ingredients except the coconut milk to a 3-quart or larger slow cooker. Cook on low 8-10 hours or in high 5-6 hours. Stir in the coconut milk and cook on low for another 30 minutes.

2. The curry will be a bit thin at first; it thickens up as it sits.

3. Scoop over rice and serve with cilantro and fresh lime wedges to squeeze over the top.
