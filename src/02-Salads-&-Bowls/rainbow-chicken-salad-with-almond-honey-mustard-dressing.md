# Rainbow Chicken Salad with Almond Honey Mustard Dressing

## Overview

- Yield: 4

## Ingredients

#### For the Salad:

- 2 teaspoons olive oil

- 8 ounces boneless, skinless chicken breasts (mine were cut into smaller, thinner pieces which made the sauteing a bit easier)

- 1/2 teaspoon salt

- 1/2 teaspoon pepper

- 1 teaspoon chili powder

- 2 cups grapes, halved

- 1 cup fresh blueberries

- 3 cups curly lettuce, chopped

- 1/2 cup feta cheese

- 1/2 cup almonds, chopped or crushed

#### For the Dressing:

- 3 tablespoons almond butter

- 1 tablespoon olive oil

- 2 tablespoons freshly squeezed orange juice

- 3 tablespoons water

- 1 tablespoon stoneground mustard

- 1/2 tablespoon raw honey

- 1/4 teaspoon salt, more to taste

- 1/2 teaspoon garlic

## Method

1. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Sprinkle the chicken with the salt, pepper, and chili powder. Saute in the oil for a few minutes, flipping the chicken now and then to cook through and get a nice golden color on both sides. When the chicken is cooked, remove from heat and set aside.

2. Cut and prep all the vegetables and fruits. When the chicken is cool enough to handle, cut into bite sized pieces. Place the salad ingredients in a large bowl â€“ you can either arrange the bowl by ingredient, like pictured, or toss everything together. Refrigerate to chill.

3. For the dressing, puree all the dressing ingredients in a food processor until smooth. Taste and adjust to your preferences. Pour dressing over salad and serve.

4. Garnish with some crumbled crispy onions on top for a little extra crunch and flavor.
