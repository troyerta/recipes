# Lamb Koftas with Yoghurt Dressing

## Overview

- Yield: 8 skewers

## Ingredients

#### Koftas:

- 1 lb / 500 g lamb mince (ground lamb)

- 1/2 onion , grated

- 1/4 cup breadcrumbs , preferably panko

- 2 cloves garlic , crushed

- 2 tbsp chopped fresh coriander

#### Kofta Spices:

- 2 tsp cumin

- 2 tsp coriander

- 2 tsp paprika

- 1.5 tsp ground cinnamon

- 1 tsp cayenne pepper (this is a bit spicy, reduce to taste or leave out)

- 1 1/2 tsp salt

- 1/2 black pepper

#### Yoghurt Sauce:

- 1 cup yogurt , Greek or other thick plain

- 1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil

- 1 clove garlic , crushed

- 1 tsp cumin

- 1 tbsp lemon juice

- 1/4 tsp salt and pepper , each

#### To Serve:

- 8 skewers (Note 1)

- 8 flatbreads (small) or 4 large, warmed ( homemade or bought, Note 2)

- Shredded Red Cabbage, Carrot and Mint Salad (Note 3)

- OR shredded lettuce, tomato and onion slices (Note 3)

## Method

1. Yogurt Sauce: Combine the yogurt sauce ingredients and leave in fridge for at least 20 mninutes for the flavor to develop (overnight even better!).
---

2. Koftas: Grate the onion into the bowl using a standard box grater. Add remaining Kofta ingredients and mix well with your hands.
---

3. With damp hands, divide the meat into 8 equal pieces and push and shape the meat onto 8 skewers. Make them smooth (looks nicer, pictured!) or a bit nubbly (more surface area to brown!).
---

#### Cooking:

1. Stove: Preheat 1/2 tbsp oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Cook in batches for 5 minutes in total, turning to brown evenly all over.
---

2. BBQ: BBQ on medium high for about 6 minutes, rotating to brown all over.
---

3. Broiler/oven grill: preheat and cook koftas 30cm/10" from heat source for 12 minutes, rotating as needed until lightly browned (you won't get as good a browning as stove/BBQ).
---

#### Serving:

1. Do a DIY spread - pile everything onto a platter a make everyone serve themselves.
---

2. Get a flatbread, smear with Yogurt Sauce, top with Red Cabbage Mint Salad (more options Note 3) then Kofta, drizzle over more Yoghurt Sauce. Devour and be happy!

## Notes

- Note: I made 1.5x for the photos. Recipe makes 8 skewers with 500g/1lb meat.

- Soak Skewers - if using wooden or bamboo skewers and planning to cook on BBQ grill or under broil/oven grill, soak for for 30 minutes prior to threading meat on.

- If using metal skewers, cooking on stove or plate side of BBQ, no need to do this.

- Flatbread - any flatbreads that can be wrapped around the koftas will work a treat here. If using small pita breads (pictured), stuff each one with 2 koftas (this is enough for a normal meal I find), or make them with 1 kofta each (pictured in post). Or use large flatbreads (like Lebanese bread) and make 1 long one.

- You could also make your own - try these Easy No Yeast Flatbreads!

- Salad for stuffing - I usually make this Red Cabbage Mint Salad which is on theme and also the fresh mint flavour goes beautifully here. Other options are:

- Shredded iceberg lettuce (or just handfuls of leafy greens) with slices of tomato and onion (like the way Doner Kebabs are made), some fresh coriander/cilantro, parsley or mint would also be lovely

- Tabbouleh - see recipe in  Doner Kebab recipe

- More options:

- This seasoned Middle Eastern Lentil Rice Pilaf (Mejadra) is super tasty and would go perfectly to serve on the side / stuffing inside the pitas

- Middle Eastern Chickpea Salad with Cucumber and Tomato (skip the chickpeas if you want) - great juicy crunch factor

- Hummus instead of / in addition to yogurt sauce

- Add a side of juicy marinated BBQ Vegetables (or road them!) - extra amazing to stuff into pitas with the koftas

- Nutrition per kofta, assuming 2 koftas stuffed in 1 pita bread and assuming fatty lamb mince is used (supermarket mince is leaner so will be less calories). Assumes all sauce used (full fat yogurt).
