3. Add the chopped garlic, Italian seasoning, and red pepper flakes and then stir the  shrimp for another minute or two to cook shrimp the other side. Transfer the grilled shrimp to a shallow plate.

4. In the same pan, add remaining butter, lemon juice, chicken or vegetable stock, and hot sauce to the pan. Bring the sauce to a simmer for 2-3 minutes, stirring regularly.
