3) Get your pasta on. Cook according to pack instructions and salt the water. Reserve 8 tablespoons of pasta water.

4) Add 3 tablespoons of pasta water to the chorizo pan, bubble it down.

5) Once pasta is al dente add it to your chorizo. Take the pan off the heat. Fold the chorizo through the pasta.
