- 2 oz Gin (modern alternatives reduce to 1 1/2 oz)

## Notes

- You can omit the egg white if desired. If so, you don't have to dry shake ingredients first.

- Variation: [Rosemary Gin Fizz](http://cookieandkate.com/2011/rosemary-gin-fizz/) (adapted) - substitute simple syrup for 1/2 tsp honey. Muddle lemon juice, honey, and 3 1-inch sprigs of rosemary in glass and top with ice, gin, and soda. **OR** just substitute with rosemary simple syrup #todo
