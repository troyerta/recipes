## Notes

- Important note: If you are making this Greek yogurt rotisserie chicken salad recipe ahead of time, wait to add the cucumber until right before you serve it to prevent the salad from getting too watery and preserve the crispness of the cucumber.

- I highly recommend using leftover rotisserie chicken (as the recipe notes) in this salad as the depth of flavor is more intense than canned chicken (bleh) or even plain grilled chicken.

- I used full-fat Greek yogurt in this recipe to keep it creamy without sacrificing flavor. You could use a lighter version of Greek yogurt but Iâ€™d recommend using a 1:1 ratio of Greek yogurt to mayonnaise if you make this swap.
