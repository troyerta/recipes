# Pub Style Soft Pretzels with Ipa Cheese Dip

## Overview

- Yield: 8
- Prep Time: 1 hr
- Cook Time: 30 mins
- Total Time: 1 hr 30 mins

## Ingredients

- 22 oz flour

- 1 tbsp sugar

- 2 tsp salt

- pretzel salt or any large flake salt for sprinkling

- 1 packet active dry yeast

- ⅔ cup baking soda

- 12 oz beer (IPA style preferred)

- 2 oz butter, melted

- 10 cups water

- 1 egg yolk

- 1 tbsp water

#### For the Beer Cheese Dip:

- 4 oz cream cheese, softened

- ¾ cup white cheddar, shredded

- ¾ cup mozzarella

- 1 tsp garlic powder

- ¼ cup beer (IPA style preferred)

- hot sauce

- 1 tbsp parsley, chopped

## Method

1. First, heat your beer to 110-115 F degrees in the microwave or in a small saucepan.
---

2. Add the warm beer into a large bowl with sugar and kosher salt. If you have a stand mixer with a dough hook attachment, feel free to use that instead of kneading by hand. Sprinkle the yeast packet on top and let it sit for 10 minutes until the mixture gets nice and foamy on top. The sugar and the warm beer create a really nurturing environment for the yeast to activate and results in really fluffy pretzels.
---

3. After the yeast is foamy, add in the butter and the flour. Either with your hands (or with your dough hook on a medium speed) knead the mixture until a dough ball has formed. This is easiest done on a floured surface like your countertop. Knead for about 5-10 minutes or until it is smooth and not sticking to your counter or mixer bowl.
---

4. Prepare a bowl for the dough to rest and rise in. This should be a large bowl that is greased with oil. When you are satisfied with your dough, transfer it to the rising bowl
---

5. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a damp towel, and leave the dough in a warm place until the dough has doubled in size (roughly 1 hour).
---

6. Tip: covering the dough prevents a skin from forming on top.
---

7. After the dough has risen, preheat the oven to 425 F and line two baking sheets with parchment paper.
---

8. Tip: Do NOT use aluminum foil instead of parchment paper. The baking soda bath is highly alkaline and will create flammable hydrogen gas is it comes in contact with aluminum foil.
---

9. Shape all the pretzels and place them on the parchment.

---

11. In a large pot, boil 10 cups of water and 2/3 cup baking soda. This is the alkaline bath the pretzels need to get a shiny brown skin like when you buy them at a store.
---

12. Two at a time, plunge the shaped pretzels into the baking soda bath, boiling them for 30 seconds on each side.
---

13. Brush each pretzel with egg wash (1 egg yolk and 1 tbsp water) and sprinkle with flaky salt. Bake for 12-15 minutes or until brown on top.
---

#### To Make the Ipa Cheese Dip:

1. Preheat oven to 350 F
---

2. In a medium bowl, combine cream cheese, grated Cheddar cheese, and 1/2 cup of the grated Mozzarella.
---

3. Add in garlic powder, beer, and hot sauce.
---

4. Pour the cheese mixture into a baking dish and sprinkle the remaining mozzarella on top and bake for about 15 minutes or until melted throughout and golden on top.
---


## Notes

- Tip: If the sauce is melted but the top is not golden, broil until golden brown on top.
