# Curried Lentils with Kale and Coconut Milk

## Overview

- Yield: 4-6 servings
- Prep Time: 15 mins
- Cook Time: 50 mins
- Total Time: 1 hr 5 mins

## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons coconut oil or peanut oil (or olive oil)

- 1 medium yellow onion, finely chopped, to yield 1-1.5 cups

- 4 garlic cloves, smashed and peeled

- Kosher salt

- 1 tablespoon finely grated fresh ginger

- 2 teaspoons yellow or brown mustard seeds

- 2 teaspoons ground turmeric

- 1 teaspoon ground coriander

- 1 teaspoon ground cumin or fennel

- 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes

- 3-1/2 cups water

- 14-ounce can unsweetened coconut milk

- 1/2 cup red lentils

- 1/2 cup French green lentils

- 6 ounces kale (or baby spinach), about 6 cups, leaves removed from stems, roughly chopped

- Fresh lime, for serving, optional

## Method

1.In a large pot over medium-high, combine the oil, onion, garlic and 1 teaspoon salt. When you hear a sizzle, cover the pot, turn heat to low, and cook, stirring every so often, until the onion has softened and is just beginning to color, 7 to 9 minutes.

2.Stir in the ginger, the mustard seeds, turmeric, coriander, fennel and red pepper flakes. Cook, stirring often, until fragrant, about 1 minute.
---
3.Add the water, coconut milk, lentils, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt, then bring to a boil.
---
4.Reduce to low, cover and simmer, stirring once or twice, until the lentils have broken down, 40 to 50 minutes.
---
5.Stir in the kale and return to a simmer.
---
6.Taste and season with salt if desired.
---
7.Serve immediately or cool and refrigerate for a future day — it’s good cold straight from the fridge.

## Notes

- Don’t be afraid to make this ahead of time — it’s even tastier on day two. Recipe doubles well, too.
