## Notes

- If you don't have food processor you could put crackers in zip lock bag and crush with rolling pin.

- Dipping sauce I used was simply a combination of mayo, Djion mustard, garlic powder, onion powder and fresh parsley.

- Nutrition information can vary based on the type of cracker crumbs used and it doesn't include the dipping sauce.
