- 1 cup chopped onion

- 4 T chopped parsley (see notes)

- 4 T chopped cilantro (see notes)

- 1 tsp. salt

- 4 cloves minced garlic (about 2 tsp.)

- 1 tsp. ground cumin

- 1 tsp. baking powder

- 4 T whole wheat flour (see notes)

- olive oil, for spraying baking sheet

### Yogurt-Tahini Sauce (SEE NOTES)

- 2/3 cup plain yogurt

- 1/3 cup Tahini Sauce (see notes)

- 2 T fresh squeezed lemon juice

- 1/2 tsp. minced garlic

- 1/2 tsp. ground cumin

- 3 T water to thin sauce if desired


## Method

### Falafel

1. Soak dried chickpeas in cold water for at least 8 hours, or over night.
---
2. After chickpeas are well-softened, drain well.
---
3. Put chickpeas, onion, parsley, cilantro, salt, garlic, and cumin into bowl of a food processor with the steel blade attached.
---
4. Pulse until mixture is well-chopped and combined, but not pureed together.
---
5. Sprinkle over baking powder and flour and pulse a few more times to combine.
---
6. Test one ball to see if mixture holds together, and if not add more flour until it does. (I didn’t need to add more flour.)
---
7. Put mixture into a plastic bowl with a tight-fitting lid and chill several hours or overnight.
---
8. When ready to bake Falafel, preheat oven or toaster oven to 400F. (I sprayed the baking sheet with olive oil and preheated the pan too, to get the outside of the Falafel extra crisp.)
---
9. Shape the mixture into 12 balls, pressing each one flat with your hands and forming into a patty not quite 1/2 inch thick.
---
10. Put patties on pan and bake until lightly browned and cooked through.
---
11. Jamie baked them about 22 minutes; I was using a toaster oven and baked mine about 26 minutes, turning after 13 minutes.
---
12. Serve warm, with Yogurt-Tahini sauce if desired.

### Sauce

1. Using a whisk or mini-processor, combine ingredients.
---
2. Add water as desired until it’s as thin as you prefer. (I added about 2 T of water.)
---
3. I sprinkled the sauce with some Ground Sumac (affiliate link), which is totally optional but good.
---
4. Serve with Falafel patties.

## Notes

- Creator increased the amount of fresh herbs; use more or less to taste.

- Use a bit more flour if the falafel patties don't stick together well enough.

- Creator adapted the sauce recipe slightly so it had more yogurt and less tahini, but make it to your own taste.
