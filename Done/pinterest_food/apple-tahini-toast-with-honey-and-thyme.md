## Ingredients

- 4 slices of your favorite bread

- 1 apple, cored and thinly sliced, I prefer Honeycrisp Apples

- 2 tablespoons local raw honey

- A few sprigs of fresh thyme

2. Spread a layer of tahini on each slice of toast.

3. Top with apple slices and a drizzle of honey, top with some fresh thyme and a little sprinkle of sea salt, optionally

## Notes

- Try subbing maple syrup for the honey

- Try other nut butters in place of the tahini, almond butter is especially recommended

- Try other herbs instead of the thyme: rosemary + almond butter
