## Notes

- Prawns - defrost if using frozen.

- Lemongrass - peel reedy outer layers and just use the bottom 12cm/5" of the stalk, the part that's white and very pale green that can be grated.

- Lemongrass paste can be used instead - stir in 1 tbsp once the coconut milk is added.

- Curry Powder - any is fine here. I use Madras, Clives of India and even packets generically labelled "curry powder" from supermarkets. Use HOT if you like it spicy, otherwise use MILD (curry flavour but not spicy)

- Chilli Paste - Any chilli paste is fine here. Even sriracha or other Asiany hot sauce. This is to add spiciness and adds colour to the sauce. I like using Chilli Garlic Paste, samba oelak or Chinese Chilli Paste.

- Low fat coconut milk can be used but the sauce won't have as good a coconut flavour and will be a bit thinner.

- Noodles - use 200g/7oz of fresh thick noodles (like pictured) or about 180g/6oz of thinner fresh noodles. Or 120 - 150g/4 - 5 oz dried noodles (any type - rice, vermicelli, egg noodles, ramen)

- Asian fried shallots - an essential garnish in Asian cooking! Slices of shallots deep fried until crispy then seasoned with salt. Terrific for texture and flavour, used regularly as a garnish in Asian cooking. Found in Asian stores and in the Asian aisle of supermarkets (Coles, Woolies in Australia)
