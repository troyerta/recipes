## Method

1. For the dressing, combine lime juice, honey, cumin garlic and salt.
---

2. In a slow, steady stream, add the oils, stirring continuously with a fork or small whisk.
---

3. Taste and add more salt and pepper, if needed. Set aside.
---

4. For the corn tortilla strips, preheat oven to 400˚F.
---

5. Stack corn tortillas on a cutting board. Cut in half. Cut each stack of halves into thin strips, widthwise, about 1/4-inch thick.
---

6. Transfer tortilla strips to a sheet pan. Drizzle with oil. Sprinkle with salt and toss to coat.
---

7. Bake for 15-20 minutes, stirring every 5 minutes, or until light golden brown and crisp. Set aside to cool.
---

8. For the salad, place corn, two ears at a time, in the microwave and cook for 3 1/2 minutes.
---

9. Remove from microwave with a hot pad and allow to cool for 5 minutes.
---

10. After cooling, cut bottom end of corn off, about 1 1/2 inches from end. Pull back husk and silks (almost all of the silk should easily pull away). Cut kernels from husks and set aside.
---

11. Combine corn and other salad ingredients in a large bowl. Stir to combine. Add dressing and stir to coat all ingredients. Garnish with cilantro leaves, if desired.
---

12. Serve with tortilla strips on top or place a bowl on the side and let guests help themselves.
