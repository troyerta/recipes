# Toffee Crunch Chocolate Cookies

## Overview

- Yield: 18-20 cookies

## Ingredients

- 1/2 cup (113 grams) butter, room temperature

- 4 oz (113 grams) semi sweet chocolate, roughly chopped

- 1/2 cup (100 grams) granulated sugar

- 1/2 cup (100 grams) dark brown sugar

- 2 eggs

- 1 cup (120 grams) all purpose flour

- 1/2 cup semi sweet chocolate chips

- 1/2 cup toffee bits

- 3/4 cup (70 grams) crumbled toffee crunch brownie brittle

## Method

1. Heat the oven to 350F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper and set aside.
---

2. In a small saucepan, add the butter and 4 oz of chocolate. Melt over a low heat, stirring until smooth.
---

3. Remove from the heat and stir in the sugars. Let cool for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. The mixture should now be warm to the touch.
---

4. With a spatula or a hand whisk, beat in the two eggs.
---

5. Gently fold in the flour, followed by the chocolate chips, toffee bits and crumbled brownie brittle.
---

6. With a medium size ice-cream scoop, drop cookie dough on the prepared baking sheets.
---

7. Bake the cookies in the preheated oven for 11-12 minutes or until just set. I prefer to slightly underbake the cookies - this way they will be chewier!
---

8. Remove from the oven and let the cookie cool completely before removing them from the baking sheets.
