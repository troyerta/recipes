# Cauliflower Pizza Base


## Ingredients

- approx. 350-400 grams of cauliflower leaves removed and roughly chopped

- 1/2 cup grated "tasty" cheese (I assume they mean something like mozzerella)

- 1/3 cup grated Parmesan cheese

- 1 egg

- 1/2 tsp. dried oregano

- 1/2 tsp. dried basil

- 1 tsp. garlic powder

## Method

1. Blitz cauliflower in food processor until it resembles rice. You should have about 3 cups of cauliflower. Place in microwave bowl and cook for 8 minutes stirring once.
---
2. Allow to cool a little then place in clean tea towel and squeeze out any liquid.
---
3. Return to bowl and add remaining ingredients with salt and pepper if needed.
---
4. Line a tray with baking paper and make into a circle patting down well.
---
5. The thinner the cauliflower the crisper the base.
---
6. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes at 180c fan forced or until golden.
---
7. Remove from oven and top with your favourite pizza topping.
---
8. Return to oven until topping is cooked to your liking.
