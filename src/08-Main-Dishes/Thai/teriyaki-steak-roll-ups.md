2. Lightly massage the marinade into the steak and cover. Refrigerate 1-4 hours.

3. Place toothpicks in a bowl and pour water over toothpicks until completely submerged. Water will prevent toothpicks from burning.

4. Once marinated, cut the steak into 8 equal rectangles. You may need to pound the steak thinner if using a thicker cut.
---

5. Place a few slices of each of the vegetables on a slice of steak, making sure they are all about the same length.
---

6. Roll the steak up over the vegetables and secure it with a toothpick.
---

7. In a small saucepan over medium heat, pour in the leftover marinade and bring to a boil.
---

8. Boil for about one minute, take off the heat, and set aside to use as a glaze.
---

9. In a grill pan or on the grill over medium high heat, place your steak roll-ups and cook for 2-3 minutes.
---

10. Flip the roll over and use a heat-safe brush to brush the glaze on each roll.
---

11. Cook for about one minute longer and remove from heat. Top with sesame seeds.
