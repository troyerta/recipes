## Overview

- Yield: 8 servings
- Prep Time: 40 mins
- Cook Time: 30 mins
- Total Time: 1 hr 10 mins

## Ingredients

#### Focaccia:

- 1 cup water

- 2 Tablespoons butter , softened

- 1 teaspoon salt

- 2 1/4- 2 2/3 cup unbleached all purpose flour

- 2 1/4 teaspoons instant yeast

#### Topping:

- 2 Tablespoons melted butter

- 1/2 teaspoon coarse ground garlic salt

- 1 Tablespoon dried parsley

- 1/3 cup asiago , parmesan, or romano cheese

## Method

1. Heat water until warm (about 105-115 degrees. One way to check water when making yeast breads is by testing the water on the inside of the wrist like you would a baby's bottle. The water should feel just warm and comfortable, not hot.
---
2. Pour the water into a large bowl and add yeast, stirring with a fork until it dissolves in. Add to this 2 1/4 cups flour, 2 tablespoons of very soft butter, and the salt. Mix until a soft dough forms, then turn the dough out onto a floured surface. Knead the dough with a push turn method, dusting with flour when needed to keep the dough from sticking to the surface. While kneading the dough, add in additional flour about a tablespoon at a time or until the dough becomes smooth and elastic. This should take about 5-10 minutes of kneading. Place the dough into an oiled bowl and cover greased plastic wrap. Let the dough rest 10 minutes.

3. After resting, place the dough onto a greased baking sheet. Using your hands, pat the dough into about a 12 inch circle. Cover again with greased plastic wrap. Place in a warm spot and let the dough rise until it has doubled in size (about 30-45 minutes.)
---
4. Heat the oven to 375 degrees.
---
5. When the dough has risen, using your finger tips, poke 1/2 to 3/4 inch deep holes throughout the dough, spacing the holes about an inch or 2 apart. Brush the top of the dough with the melted butter, making sure to get some on the top of the foccacia bread and down in the holes as well. Sprinkle the top of the dough with the garlic salt, parsley, and shredded cheese. Place in the oven and bake for 25-30 minutes or until nice and golden brown. Serve hot.
