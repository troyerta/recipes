- 600 g / 1.2lb chicken thighs , boneless skinless, cut into 2cm/4/5" pieces (Note 2)

## Method

---

#### Thai Chicken Satay Skewers:

1. Mix together the chicken and Marinade with 1/4 cup of coconut milk, then set aside for at least 20 minutes, or overnight.
---

2. Thread onto skewers - I do 4 to 5 pieces each.
---

3. Heat 1.5 tbsp oil in a large non stick pan over medium high heat.
---

4. Cook skewers in batches for 3 minutes on each side until golden.
---

#### Thai Peanut Sauce:

1. Place remaining coconut milk and Peanut Sauce ingredients in a saucepan over medium low heat.
---

2. Stir to combine then simmer, stirring every now and then, for 5 minutes.
---

3. Adjust consistency with water - it should be a pourable but thickish sauce.
---

4. Cover with lid and keep warm while cooking skewers.
---

#### Serving:

1. Pour some sauce into a bowl. Sprinkle with some peanuts - stir some through if you want.
---

2. Pile satay skewers onto a platter, sprinkle with remaining peanuts, coriander and chilli.
---

3. Serve with sauce on the side for dipping.

## Notes

- Skewers used for Asian chicken satay tend to be shorter than Western skewers. I like them because they fit in skillets! Feel free to make giant ones with longer skewers.

- Chicken - can be substituted with breast or tenderloin but thigh is best for juiciest chicken. Can also sub with beef or pork - use a good, nicely marbled cut suitable for quick cooking.

- Curry powder - any is fine here. I use Clives or Keens.

- Red curry paste - The best Thai red curry paste (in my opinion) is Maesri which comes in small cans and also happens to be the cheapest. Sold at large supermarkets (Coles, Woolies, Harris), Asian stores. But any brand will do because it's an enhancer rather than key flavouring.

- If using homemade Thai red curry paste, double the curry paste, add 1 tsp fish sauce + 1 tsp sugar into chicken marinade, and 2 tsp fish sauce + 2 tsp sugar into Peanut Sauce (homemade doesn't have the seasonings jar paste does).

- Natural peanut butter is 100% peanuts and has a stronger peanut flavour than commercial peanut butter which has sugar and other additives. It is also thinner so less water is required to achieve the right consistency. Pretty widely available nowadays in the health food section of supermarkets.

- Can use normal peanut butter spread but the peanut flavour is not as good and sauce will be thicker. Do not be tempted to dilute with too much water - it will dilute the flavour.

- Sub: 1 cup raw unsalted peanuts blitzed until smooth with 1/2 cup or so coconut milk called for in the peanut sauce (helps make it super smooth).

- Dark soy sauce adds seasoning and deepens colour of sauce. Can sub with light or all purpose soy sauce but sauce colour will be lighter.

- Cider vinegar can be subbed with plain white vinegar. Lime juice, rice vinegar or other clear vinegars are an ok substitute but not 100% authentic.

- Peanut Sauce - makes more than you will need, probably only use 1/3.  Hard to make less, also this recipe uses a whole can of coconut milk. Lasts 1 week in the fridge - or freeze.

- Use leftover for:

- Sauce for for rice, noodles, veggies (raw or steamed)

- Make a simple Gado Gado with steam veg, hard boiled eggs and rice

- Dip for prawn crackers and vegetables

- As the dressing for this Chinese Chicken Salad, Satay Noodle Salad,  Peanut Noodle Salad or Sesame Noodles
