# Apricot Salsa Quesadillas

## Ingredients

- 2-3 tomatoes, (depending on size)

- 1 fresh apricot, , de-stoned (see notes)

- 1/2 green bell pepper

- 1 shallot

- 1/4 tsp ground cinnamon

- 1/4 tsp smoked paprika

- juice and zest of 1/2 a lime

- 3 tbsp grated Red Leicester or Cheddar Cheese, (or some other cheese)

- 2 small tortillas

## Method

2. Roughly chop up the tomatoes, bell pepper and apricot together to make a salsa.

3. Fry this in a small skillet with a little oil, along with the sliced shallot, cinnamon, paprika, lime zest and juice. Cook over a medium heat for about 5 minutes, until the shallot is slightly translucent.

4. If you're going to use this skillet to heat the tortilla, then remove the vegetable mixture to a plate and set aside, then clean and dry the skillet. Or, if you're just going to use a different skillet, just set the veg mixture aside.

5. Either way, heat a clean, dry skillet and place one tortilla into it. Sprinkle the cheese over the surface of the tortilla and heat on medium-low until the cheese melts and the underside of the tortilla is golden-brown. Quickly spoon the vegetable mixture over the cheesy tortilla, top with the second tortilla and carefully flip the whole thing over using a spatula. Cook until the underside of this second tortilla is golden brown.

6. Remove from the skillet and cut into wedges.
