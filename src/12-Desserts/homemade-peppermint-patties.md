# Homemade Peppermint Patties

## Overview

- Yield: 24
- Prep Time: 2 Hr
- Total Time: 2 Hr

## Ingredients

- 3/4 cup sweetened condensed milk

- 1 1/2 teaspoons peppermint extract

- 4 cups powdered sugar

- 3 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips

- 2 teaspoons shortening

## Method

1. In a large mixing bowl, combine sweetened condensed milk and peppermint extract.
---
2. Beat in the powdered sugar just a little at a time, until a stiff dough starts to form and the dough isn't sticky.
---
3. Form into 1 inch balls, then place on waxed paper and flatten with fingers to form patties. Let patties dry at room temperature for about two hours (I turned flipped mine over after about 1 hours to make sure they were evenly set on both sides).
---
4. In a medium saucepan over low heat, melt chocolate with shortening, stirring often (you could also melt the chocolate in the microwave- just do whatever you are comfortable with!).
---
5. Remove chocolate from heat.
---
6. Dip patties, one at a time, into chocolate by laying them on the tines of a fork and lowering the fork into the liquid.
---
7. Let cool on waxed paper until set. Place in the fridge so let them set-up even faster (I actually prefer to eat them straight out of the fridge).

## Notes

### Tips on dipping:
- Tip 1: Make sure your candy centers are completely frozen. You will want to be sure they aren’t gooey, because the chocolate you are dipping them in is going to be hot, and will melt the candy centers.
- Tip 2: Some recommend freezing the candy centers on a wax paper lined, cookie sheet.
- Tip 3: Once frozen, heat up the chocolate, and stir continually, to ensure that it doesn’t dry up.
- Tip 4: Get a plastic fork, and remove the two middle prongs of the fork, so it is only the two outside prongs.
- Tip 5: Place the frozen patty in the middle, so the prongs are holding it up. Dip in the chocolate. Flip, and remove from the chocolate. Let the excess chocolate drip off.
- Tip 6: Place on aluminum foil or wax paper. Let cool completely. Some recommend refrigerating or freezing them. They are delicious frozen.

### Tips on storing:
- These peppermint patties save well. If you are making them a week in advance, some recommend keeping them in an airtight container, and placing them in the fridge.
- However, if you are making them for longer than a week in advance, place them in an airtight container, and put them in the freezer.
- Remove them from the freezer 24 hours before serving them, unless you are wanting to serve them frozen, which is also delicious.
