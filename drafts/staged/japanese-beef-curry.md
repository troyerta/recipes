## Method

1. Gather all the ingredients.
---

#### To Prepare Ingredients:

1. Cut the onion into thin slices. Cut the carrot diagonally while rotating it a quarter between cuts (in Japanese we call this cutting technique “ rangiri”).
---

2. Cut the potato in half, and then cut each piece into quarters. Soak in water for 15 minutes to remove the starch.
---

3. Clean the mushrooms (I use a pastry brush and avoid washing mushrooms as they absorb moisture. However, it's okay to quickly rinse them.). Then cut them into thin slices.
---

4. Cut the beef into 1 ½ inch cubes and sprinkle salt and pepper. Then lightly coat the meat with the flour.
---

#### To Cook the Curry:

1. In a cast iron skillet, heat 1 Tbsp oil and 1 Tbsp butter on high heat. Add the beef in the pan but do not crowd the skillet as you would end up "steam" the beef. Make sure to cook in batches.  Cook the beef on both sides until brown, about 10-15 minutes. If you cook in batches, transfer the cooked beef to a plate and work on the next batch.
---

2. In a large heavy-bottomed pot or large pot, heat 1 Tbsp butter on medium heat and add the onion. Add 1 Tbsp olive oil and stir to coat the onion with the oil. Add 1 tsp salt after 10 minutes and sauté the onion until tender and translucent, about 20-25 minutes. If you have time, you can spend more time until the onions are caramelized, about 40 minutes or so.
---

3. Add garlic, ginger, curry powder, and tomato paste and sauté for 2 minutes.
---

4. Add the beef and the wine and let the alcohol evaporate, for 5 minutes.
---

5. Add the vegetable and pour the beef broth until it covers the vegetables (You do not need to use all of it). Cover with the lid and bring it to a boil.
---

6. When boiling, skim off the scum and fat from the soup. I prepare a 2-cup measuring cup and clean my fine mesh skimmer in the water. It’s easy to remove the scum/fat from the fine mesh this way.
---

7. Add bay leaf, cover with the lid but leaving slightly ajar, and simmer until vegetables are tender, about 20 minutes.
---

8. Once in a while, skim the broth to clean the surface of the broth. Add the leftover beef broth (or water) only if necessary (evaporate too much).
---

9. Once the ingredients are all tender, add curry roux. Turn off the heat. With a fork/chopsticks, let the curry roux dissolved completely inside the ladle and then release to the broth. That way, the undissolved roux won't end up in the broth. If the curry is too thick for your taste, add water to dilute. From this point, cook on the lowest heat and stir often and be careful not to burn the curry!
---

10. Add milk and Worcestershire sauce. Grate the apple to add a hint of sweetness. Simmer uncovered on the lowest heat, stirring occasionally, until the curry becomes the consistency you like.
