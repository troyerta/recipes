Servings: 1 drink

INGREDIENTS

4 limes, quartered
1/2 cup fresh mint leaves
1-2 tablespoons granulated sugar (optional)
4 ounces (1/2 cup) white rum
2 ounces (1/4 cup) coconut rum
1 cup canned full fat coconut milk well stirred
2-3 cans (12 ounce) ginger beer for topping

LIME SUGAR:

zest of 1 lime
2 tablespoons granulated sugar
flaky sea salt

STEPS

1) To make the lime sugar. Combine the lime zest, sugar, and a pinch of salt on a shallow plate. Rim your glasses in sugar, then fill with ice.

2) Combine the lime juice, mint, and sugar (if using) in a large pitcher. Stir until the sugar is dissolved, about 2-3 minutes. Add the white rum, coconut rum, and coconut milk, stirring to evenly combine. Chill until ready to serve.

3) When ready to serve, pour into glasses and top off each glass with ginger beer, gently stirring to combine. Enjoy!


NOTES

Foam on Top: the mojito will have foam on top once you add the ginger beer. Just gently stir to combine and the foam will subside.

Coconut Milk Separation: as the mojito sits in the ice, the coconut milk may slowly separate from the rum. I don't normally notice it much, but coconut milk brands vary and can cause different outcomes. Just gently stir to mix everything, then continue drinking!

Sugar: I don't personally add the sugar to the drink, as I find the drink to be sweet enough with the sugared rim and the ginger beer, but if you like a sweeter drink, use the sugar.
