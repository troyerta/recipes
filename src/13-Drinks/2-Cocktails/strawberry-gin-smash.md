# Strawberry Gin Smash

## Overview

- Yield: 1 - 8

- Prep Time: 5 mins

- Total Time: 5 mins

## Ingredients

### For a pitcher:

- 2 tablespoons granulated sugar

- 2 limes, juiced (about 1/4 cup)

- 1 pound fresh strawberries

- 2 cups gin

- 3 cups club soda

- Fresh mint sprigs, for garnish

### For a single drink:

- 1/2 teaspoon granulated sugar

- 1 lime wedge

- 3 fresh strawberries, 2 hulled and sliced and 1 reserved for garnish

- 3 ounces gin

- Club soda

- Fresh mint sprig, for garnish


## Method

### For a pitcher:

1. Muddle the sugar and limes in a pitcher that holds at least 8 cups (64 ounces). Set aside 6 to 8 small strawberries and make a small slice in their tips. Hull and slice the remaining strawberries and muddle the slices lightly with the sugar and lime juice.
---
2. Stir in the gin and club soda and pack the pitcher full of ice. Add mint sprigs to garnish. Pour into ice-filled glasses and garnish with a strawberry, slotted onto the edge of the glass.

### For a single drink:

1. In a tall glass, combine the sugar and a squeeze of juice from the lime wedge. Muddle with the back of a spoon to dissolve the sugar. Add the sliced strawberries and lightly muddle.
---
2. Fill the glass with ice and add the gin. Top with a splash of club soda and garnish with the last strawberry and a sprig of mint.

## Notes

- Make-ahead: Mix everything except the club soda and ice, then refrigerate overnight. A night in the fridge will also help the strawberries add more flavor and color to the drink.
