**Method**

**Garam Masala**

* Heat a cast-iron skillet over a medium heat
* Separate cardamom, coriander, cumin, peppercorns, cloves, fennel, cinnamon, star anise, and mace. Add an individual spice to the pan. Cook, tossing frequently, until aromatic and toasted-smelling. Smaller spices and spices with thin skins need just a minute, larger ones take a few minutes longer.
* Transfer to a spice grinder or mortar and pestle. Add ground nutmeg. Grind into a fine powder.
* Toast and grind the cumin and coriander seeds for marinade and sauce
* Toast and grind 3 tablespoons whole cumin, then divide into 2 tablespoons for the marinade, 1 tablespoon for the sauce. Then toast and grind 1 teaspoon coriander for the sauce.
* For the marinade
* In a food processor, combine garlic ginger paste, chili, lime juice, oil, salt, and spices. Process until a rough paste forms, then add yogurt and process until smooth. Transfer to a large ziplock bag or leak-proof container and add chicken. Marinate for 4-6 hours, a maximum of 12 hours.

**For the Sauce**

* Adjust oven rack to center position and preheat oven to 350°F.
* Soak cashews in 1 cup milk/cream.
* Heat 2 tablespoons ghee in a large heavy-bottomed pot oven over medium heat.
* When hot, toss in the cinnamon stick, cloves, mace, star anise, green cardamoms, fresh curry leaves and the bay leaves and fry for about 30 seconds.
* Add 6 tablespoons ghee. When melted, add chili powder, paprika, cumin, and coriander. Fry for 30 seconds.
* Add onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 8 minutes. Add a pinch or two of salt to draw out the liquid. Lower heat to medium-low, cook, stirring frequently, until onions are very sweet and a rich golden-brown color, approximately 1 hour. Although the onions shouldn’t burn because of the ghee, if browned onion juices on bottom of pot threaten to burn, add 1 tablespoon chicken stock, scrape up browned bits, and continue cooking; add chicken stock whenever needed to prevent burning.
* While onions are caramelizing, prepare roasted garlic. Place head in the center of a sheet of aluminum foil. Drizzle with 1 tablespoon olive oil and season with salt. Wrap tightly with foil and place on a baking sheet or oven-safe skillet, then transfer to oven. Roast until garlic is completely tender, about 1 hour.
* Squeeze 8 cloves out of garlic head and mash into a paste with the back of a fork, then add to caramelized onions.
* Add tomatoes, 3 cups chicken stock, ginger, carrot, chilies, cinnamon, vinegar, cashews (discarding the milk/cream) and 1 teaspoon salt. Cover and bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium and cook uncovered at a hard simmer, stirring occasionally, until sauce thickens, about 20 minutes.
* Pick out the larger spices (don’t worry if you can’t get them all), then blend the sauce in blender (not food processer) in batches until smooth. Add blended sauce to pot.
* After blending sauce, melt 3 tablespoons butter in a small frying pan over medium heat. When melted, add the turmeric and fenugreek leaves to the butter. Fry for 30 seconds.
* Add infused butter and chicken to sauce in pot, then simmer for 10 minutes.
* To finish the sauce, add the garam masala, finely chopped cilantro, and cream. Simmer for a minute or so longer, taking care to keep the heat low so the sauce does not split.
* Add the honey.
* Season to taste with salt and pepper.
* Garnish with cilantro and serve with basmati rice.

**For the chicken**

* Adjust oven rack to highest position and preheat broiler to high. Remove chicken from marinade and wipe off excess marinade with hands. Arrange similar sized chicken breasts in a single layer on a wire rack set inside a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet. Broil until color darkens and some dark blisters form, about 10-12 minutes. Flip chicken, rotate sheet pan, and broil until color darkens on other side, about 10-12 minutes. Repeat if necessary, broiling chicken 5-6 minutes more per side, until chicken registers around 160°F on an instant read thermometer inserted into the thickest part (don't worry, chicken will finish cooking in sauce), and one side has significant charring on edges. Set aside to rest.
* Cut chicken into bite sized pieces.

**For the rice**

* Place the rice in a large bowl under a running faucet. Swish the rice around for a few minutes until the water in the bowl is clear. Transfer rice to a strainer and rinse it for 1 minute under a running faucet.
* In a large pot, heat the ghee and oil over medium-high heat.
* Add the rice and sauté for about 1 minute, and then add the water and salt.
* Bring to a boil then immediately lower the heat. Place the lid onto the pot.
* Keep heat on low and cook for 20 minutes.
* Remove from heat and let sit for 10 minutes.
* Fluff with fork and serve.

## Notes

If you want to save time, you can skip toasting and grinding the whole spices and instead using pre-ground spices. You can also save time by preparing the ingredients while the onions are caramelizing. Since they are fried in ghee, there is less of a chance that they will burn, but you should still plan on stirring them every minute or so.

Fresh curry leaves and chilies can be found at most Indian markets, but Indian bay leaves may be harder to find. I had to order mine on amazon.

The spices may be difficult to pick out of the sauce, but don’t worry if you can get them all out. Just focus on getting the larger spices out like the cinnamon stick, bay leaves, star anise, etc. The rest can be blended with the sauce.

It is best to marinate the chicken for only a few hours since the marinade has citrus in it. If the chicken is marinated too long, it will actually become denser and tougher. The main point of the marinade is to create a crust on the chicken when it is broiled. I usually marinate the chicken in the morning and cook it in the evening when I get home from work. You should aim to marinate it a maximum of 12 hours.
