# Oven Baked Parmesan Seasoned Fries

## Overview

- Yield: 1 lb of fries
- Prep Time: 15 mins
- Cook Time: 45 mins
- Total Time: 1 hr

## Ingredients

- 1 pound of medium russet potatoes (approx 3 medium potatoes)

- 1 1/2 TBSP of Extra Virgin Olive Oil

- 1/4 tsp Dried Thyme

- 1/4 tsp Dried Oregano

- 1/8 tsp Dried Rosemary

- 1/4 tsp of Garlic Powder

- 1/4 tsp of Old Bay Seasoning

- 2 TBSP of Kraft Parmesan Style Grated Cheese (I used reduced fat)

## Method

1. Preheat oven to 425.
---

2. Wash and cut potatoes into 1/8ths.
---

3. Place on a cookie sheet that has been lined with foil (I used Reynolds Release foil so that they will not stick, but you could also either use non-stick cooking spray or lightly grease the top of the foil with extra virgin olive oil).
---

4. Mix all of the spices and the parmesan cheese in a small bowl.
---

5. Place all of the potatoes (remember we are talking about one pound at a time) into a gallon size freezer bag, add olive oil and the parmesan cheese/spice mixture to the bag.
---

6. Seal the bag and shake until the potatoes are evenly coated.
---

7. Once thoroughly coated dump onto the prepared cookie sheet and spread in a single layer.
---

8. Bake 30-45 minutes or until tender and lightly golden brown. (Baking times will vary depending on the amount of fries that you make and the size that you cut them).
