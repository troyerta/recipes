# Caramel Apple Brie Quesadillas

## Overview

- Yield: 2 quesadillas

## Ingredients

#### Easy Caramel Sauce:

- 14 Werther's OriginalÂ® Baking Caramels, unwrapped

- 1 Tablespoon heavy cream, half-and-half, or full fat milk

#### Quesadillas:

- butter or oil, for the pan

- 4 whole wheat tortillas (I use 8 or 9 inch flour tortillas)

- 4-6 ounces brie, sliced (rind removed)*

- 1 small apple, thinly sliced

## Method

1. Make the caramel sauce first: Add the caramels and cream to a small saucepan over low-medium heat. Constantly stir, allowing the caramels to fully melt. Once melted, turn off the stove and let the caramel sit in the pan until ready to use. You could also use a microwave to melt the caramels and cream together, but you would have to stop and stir every minute or so. I find the stove melts the caramels more evenly and it is much easier.

2. Make the quesadillas: Heat 1/2 teaspoon of butter or oil in a large skillet. Use enough to coat the entire bottom of the pan. You may need to add a little more than 1/2 teaspoon. Lay 1 tortilla in the skillet and top with 2-3 ounces of brie. However much or little cheese you'd like. I like a lot of cheese, so I use 3 ounces per quesadilla. Top the cheese with a few pieces of thinly sliced apples. I used about 8-9 thin slices per quesadilla. You'll have some slices leftover.

3. Top with another tortilla and press down with the back of a spatula to get the tortillas nice and tight together. Allow to cook until the cheese begins to melt, about 3 minutes. Lift up the bottom of the tortilla to make sure the bottom is browning. Once browned to your liking, flip the quesadilla onto the other side using a large spatula. Cook the underside for about 3 minutes until it reaches your desired brownness.

4. Slide onto a large cutting board and cut into 4 pieces. Butter the skillet again and repeat with other quesadillas. If preparing several quesadillas at once, slide un-cut quesadillas onto a baking sheet and keep warm in a 200F oven and slice into wedges just before serving.

5. Drizzle caramel over the quesadillas. If the caramel became too hard and solid during this time, warm it back up on the stove for 2 minutes before drizzling. Serve immediately. Leftover caramel may be stored in the refrigerator for 1 week. Warm it up before using again.
