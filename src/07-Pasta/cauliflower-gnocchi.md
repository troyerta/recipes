# Cauliflower Gnocchi

## Overview

- Yield: 3 servings

## Ingredients

- 5 cups cauliflower, roughly chopped

- 1 ¾ cups all-purpose flour, or gluten-free flour

- ¾ teaspoon salt

- 1 tablespoon olive oil


## Method

1. Add the cauliflower to a steamer basket set over a medium pot of boiling water. Cover and steam for 10 minutes, or until fork-tender.
---
2. Transfer the cauliflower to a clean dish towel and squeeze the excess water into a bowl.
---
3. Transfer the squeezed cauliflower to a food processor. Add the flour, salt, and olive oil and pulse until the dough forms a ball.
---
4. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and knead for 3-4 minutes, or until the dough bounces back when poked.
---
5. Shape the dough into a ball, then cut into 4 equal pieces.
---
6. Working 1 piece at a time, cut in half again, then roll out a rope about 6 inches (3-cm) long and 1 inch (2-cm) wide. Slice each rope into ½-inch (1-cm) pieces.
---
7. Roll each piece along the back of a fork to create a line pattern.
---
8. Transfer the gnocchi to a large pot of salted boiling water. Boil until the gnocchi float to the surface, 3-5 minutes, then remove with a slotted spoon.
