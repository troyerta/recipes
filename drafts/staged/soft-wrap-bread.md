# Soft Wrap Bread

## Overview

- Yield: 8 wraps

## Ingredients

- 3 to 3 1/4 cups (361g to 390g) King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour

- 1 1/4 cups (283g) boiling water

- 1/4 cup (43g) potato flour or 1/2 cup (43g) dried potato flakes

- 1 1/4 teaspoons salt

- 2 tablespoons (25g) vegetable oil

- 1 teaspoon instant yeast

## Method

1. Place 2 cups (240g) of the flour into a bowl or the bucket of a bread machine. Pour the boiling water over the flour, and stir until smooth. Cover the bowl or bucket and set the mixture aside for 30 minutes.
---

2. In a separate bowl, whisk together the potato flour (or flakes) and 1 cup (120g) of the remaining flour with the salt, oil and yeast.
---

3. Add this to the cooled flour/water mixture, stir, then knead for several minutes — by hand, mixer or bread machine — to form a soft dough. Add additional flour only if necessary; if kneading by hand, keep your hands and work surface lightly oiled. A 5-minute knead in the bread machine, once it gets up to full kneading speed, is fine. Let the dough rise, covered, for 1 hour.
---

4. Divide the dough into 8 pieces (each about the size of a large plum, around 3 ounces), cover, and let rest for 15 to 30 minutes.
---

5. Roll each piece into a 7" to 8" circle, and dry-fry them (fry without oil) over medium heat for about 1 minute per side, until they're puffed and flecked with brown spots. Adjust the heat if they seem to be cooking either too quickly, or too slowly; cooking too quickly means they may be raw in the center, while too slowly will dry them out.
---

6. Transfer the cooked breads to a wire rack, stacking them to keep them soft.
---

7. Serve immediately, or cool slightly before storing in a plastic bag for up to 4 days. Freeze for up to a month.

## Notes

- This recipe works best with instant yeast because it dissolves during the kneading process, so you don't have to knead liquid into the dough. If you really prefer to use active dry yeast, use only 1 cup boiling water for the initial dough, dissolve the yeast in 1/4 cup warm water, and add this mixture to the dough along with the potato flour mixture. It'll be somewhat "slippery" at first, but will knead in and eventually become smooth.
