# Mexican Street Corn Soup

## Overview

- Yield: 5 cups of soup

## Ingredients

- 1/4 cup olive or vegetable oil

- 6 cups fresh corn kernels , from 8-10 shucked cobs (save 6 of the stripped cobs for simmering the soup)

- 1 cup chopped yellow onion

- 1/4 teaspoon ancho chili powder (use more or less, depending on your heat preferences)*

- kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

- 2 large garlic cloves , chopped (about 1 tablespoon)

- 4 cups chicken or vegetable broth

- 1/2 cup sour cream

- 1/2 cup grated dry/aged Cotija cheese , plus additional for garnish (substitute Parmesan or Romano if Cotija is unavailable)

- 1 tablespoon fresh lime juice

- 1 teaspoon grated lime zest

- 2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons chopped cilantro , divided

## Method

1. Heat oil in a large, nonstick pot or cast iron Dutch oven until shimmering. Add corn kernels, chopped onion, chili powder, 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper. Cook over medium-high heat, stirring frequently, until onions are soft and corn is lightly charred in spots, about 8-10 minutes.
---

2. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, 1 minute. Remove 1-1/2 cups of corn mixture from the pot and set aside. Stir broth and 6 stripped corn cobs into the pot, scraping up the brown bits on the bottom. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer for 20 minutes.
---

3. Use tongs to remove corn cobs from pot and discard.

4. Stir sour cream and Cotija into the soup. Transfer soup to a blender or food processor (in batches, depending on the size of your unit for safety) to puree until smooth.
---

5. Return soup to pot and if needed, gently reheat to desired serving temperature. Stir in half (3/4 cup) of the reserved corn mixture, lime juice, and 2 tablespoons chopped cilantro. Season to taste with salt, pepper, and chili powder.
---

6. Toss remaining 3/4 cup corn with lime zest and 2 teaspoons chopped cilantro. Serve soup, topped with a few spoonfuls of the corn mixture, and an extra sprinkling of Cotija.

## Notes

- Tip: To strip corn, place cob horizontally on a cutting board and shave the kernels with a sharp knife, rotating the cob as you go. Alternatively, brace the tapered end of the cob vertically in the center of a Bundt or tube pan, shaving the kernels from top to bottom as they fall into the pan.

- Want to add a little extra heat and flavor? Try sautéing 1 finely chopped jalapeño or poblano (seeds removed) with the onion and corn.
