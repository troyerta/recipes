# Slow Cooker Chicken Tandoori

## Overview

A non-traditional recipe for Tandoori-style chicken without a Tandoori oven

## Tools

Slow Cooker

Searing torch

## Ingredients

- 2 lbs chicken - breast or thigh

### Marinade

- 1 cup Plain Yoghurt

- 1/2 Tbsp Coriander I've used both ground and dried before and both work well

- 2-3 Tbsp Lemon Juice - or 1/2 of a juiced lemon if fresh

- 1/2 Tbsp Cumin

- 1/2 Tbsp Cayenne Pepper to taste - look for "warmth" over "spicy"

- 1/2 Tbsp Turmeric

- 1.5 Tbsp Paprika (sweet preferred over spicy here)

- 1/2 Tbsp Smoked Paprika

- 1 Tbsp Tandoori masala

- 4 Cloves Garlic (crushed)

- 2 Tbsp Ginger (fresh or powder)

- 1/2 tsp salt

- A splash of boiled water if marinade needs thinned

### Sauce

- Water as needed to set consistency and flavor intensity

## Method

### Marinate the Chicken

1. Add yogurt and all spices to a tub/ bowl, and stir through until evenly mixed
---

2. Place chicken in marinade and leave for a least 4 hours - (ideally overnight)
---

### Prep for the Cooker: (if using chicken thighs)

3. Heat a pan with a spritz of oil
---

4. Place chicken thighs skin down and allow to sear about 4-5 minutes
---

5. Flip over and repeat
---

### Add to Slow Cooker

6. Pop all chicken into slow cooker. Thighs will take longer than breast. Cook until chicken cuts with a fork.
---

### Finishing

7. Blow torch for a few minutes to char. This is the "Tandoori" style finish. A grill works for this too.

## Serve

With basmati rice and naan
