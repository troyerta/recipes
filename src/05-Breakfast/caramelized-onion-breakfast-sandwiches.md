# Caramelized Onion Breakfast Sandwiches

## Overview

- Yield: 6

## Ingredients

- 1 large white onion

- 2 tablespoons butter, divided

- 1 tablespoon vegetable stock or water

- 1 oz mushrooms or other veggies (bell pepper would be good here too)

- 6 eggs

- 2 tablespoons milk

- 4 oz. shredded cheese (I used Monterey Jack but cheddar would be great too.)

- 6 croissants

- poppy seeds or sesame for garnish

## Method

#### 1. Caramelize them onions.

- In a large pan or skillet melt one tablespoon of butter over medium/low heat.

- Add the chopped onion and cook for 40-50 minutes until very brown and jam-like.

- Turn off the heat and stir in a tablespoon of vegetable stock or water. Stir well, making sure to scrape up and incorporate the bottom layer that may be clinging to the bottom of the pan.

- Salt, and now they are ready for use.

#### 2. Make sandwiches

- Whisk together the eggs and milk.

- In a large skillet, add a little oil and cook the mushrooms (or other veggies) along with the caramelized onions until everything is nice and warm.

- Add the eggs to the pan and stir until soft scrambled. They should be slightly undercooked here ( since they will cook a bit more in the oven ) so don’t be afraid to leave them a bit runny.

- Slice the croissants in half and fill with the eggs and top with cheese, arranged in a rectangle baking dish.

- Add the croissant tops, and then brush with melted butter and top with poppy seeds.

- Bake at 350°F for 5-6 minutes, just until the cheese looks melted.

## Notes

- Serve along with fresh fruit or a breakfast salad. Enjoy! xo. Emma

- If you are a meat eater, you could totally substitute the mushrooms for cooked, chopped bacon here. If that’s, like, your thing.

- You can store caramelized onions in a covered bowl or container in the refrigerator for at least a week, but maybe more. You can also make them the night before you plan to make these breakfast sandwiches so it’s easy to throw everything together just before it’s time to serve them.
