3. Get your rice on. Cook according to pack instructions.

4. Meanwhile cut the onion into quarters. Add 3/4 of your coriander saving the rest for garnish. Peel the garlic and ginger and remove the stalk from the chilli (and the seeds if you don’t like it too spicy). Blitz everything in a small food processor, with a splash of water, to a paste - this is your curry base.

5. Get a large saucepan over a medium heat. Pour in some oil then scrape in the curry paste. Cook and stir for 5 minutes.

6. Tip in the coconut milk, then simmer the curry sauce gently away until the roasted roots are ready then tip them into the pan.

7. Cut the lime in half and squeeze the juice into the curry and stir. Season with salt and pepper. If you haven’t already, make sure your almonds are lightly toasted.

8. Serve with rice, top with toasted flaked almonds and the coriander leaves.
