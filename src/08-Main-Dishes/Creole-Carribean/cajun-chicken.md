2. Line a baking pan with foil and spray with cooking spray. Spread chicken out onto baking pan.
---
3. Stir all ingredients for the spice mix mixture together in a small bowl until it reaches the consistency of a thin paste.
---
4. Toss chicken tenders in the seasoning, and spray evenly with cooking spray.
---
5. Roast in preheated oven for 16-18 minutes, or until chicken is cooked through (no longer pink in the center of the thickest piece), and/or reaches an internal temp of 165 degrees.
---
6. Sprinkle with an extra dash of paprika just before serving if desired (this will give the chicken a pretty pop of color and flavor, but isnâ€™t needed).
