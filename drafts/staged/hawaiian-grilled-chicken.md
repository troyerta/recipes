# Hawaiian Grilled Chicken

## Overview

- Yield: 12

## Ingredients

- 3 pounds of boneless skinless chicken thighs

#### 1 Cup Low-Sodium Soy Sauce (See Note; the Soy Sauce and Water Just Needs To Be A 1:

- 1 cup water

- 1 - 1 1/2 cups brown sugar

- 1/2 bunch of green onions , chopped (reserve the other half for garnish)

- 1/2 teaspoon minced garlic

- 1 teaspoon of sesame oil (not essential but add it if you have it)

- 1 13.5 ounce can of coconut milk

## Method

1. Trim chicken thighs of any visible fat. Mix soy sauce, water, brown sugar, onions, garlic, sesame oil, and coconut milk in a large bowl. Marinade chicken for at least 8 hours or overnight to make sure the flavor gets infused.

2. Grill chicken at a low heat so that the marinade does not burn for 5-7 minutes per side or until done. If you do not have a grill you can use a indoor grill pan.

3. Serve over a platter of coconut rice and garnish with green onions and a drizzle of additional soy sauce.

4. Coconut rice can be made by just replacing half of the water in your rice recipe with coconut milk. A trick my SIL told me! So good with just the right amount of coconut flavor.
