## Overview

- Yield: 6 flatbreads

## Ingredients

- 500 g (1 pound) flour

- 150 ml (5 fl. oz) warm milk

- 150 ml (5 fl. oz) warm water

- 1 tsp salt

- 2 tbsp dry yeast

- 3 tbsp olive oil

- chopped parsley, chili flakes

## Method

1. Whisk flour with salt and yeast. Add warm water and milk and knead just until liquids absorb.

2. Add olive oil and knead until smooth dough forms (around 10 minutes).

3. Form the dough into a ball, cover with vegetable oil and set aside in warm place for 1 hour or until doubled in size.

4. When the dough is done rising, cut it into 6 and roll each piece into a ball.

5. Roll out each flatbread and place on a pan preheated on medium-high heat. Cook for 5-6 minutes (2.5-3 minutes on each side). When you flip each flatbread it should rise up to make a pocket in the middle.
