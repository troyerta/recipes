# Coffee Truffles

## Overview

- Yield: 24 truffles

## Ingredients

#### Metric - Us Cups:

- 250 g milk chocolate

- 75 ml double cream (heavy cream)

- 2 tbsp Kahlua coffee liqueur

- 1 tbsp instant coffee granules

- 200 g milk, plain(dark) or white chocolate , for coating

- cocoa powder for dusting optional

## Method

1. Line a 900g (2lb) loaf tin with parchment.

2. Break the milk chocolate into small pieces.
---

3. Heat the cream in a small saucepan with the Kahlua and coffee granules over a low heat stirring until the coffee has dissolved and the cream is beginning to bubble around the edge of the pan.
---

4. Remove from the heat and stir in the chocolate. Stir constantly until the chocolate has melted and combined with the cream to produce a smooth chocolate cream (ganache).
---

5. Immediately pour into the lined loaf tin and allow to cool, then chill for 2 â€“ 4 hours until firm.
---

6. Remove the mixture from the tin and cut into 24 pieces. Pinch and roll each piece into ball and place on a baking tray lined with parchment. Return to the refrigerator until you are ready to roll the chocolates.

7. To coat the truffles, melt about two thirds of the chocolate over a pan of hot water. Remove from the heat. Add the remaining chocolate and stir continuously until all the chocolate has melted.
---

8. Dip the fingertips of both hands into tempered chocolate and pick up a truffle. Roll the truffle in a circular movement between your fingertips until coated in the chocolate. Place on a clean sheet of baking parchment.
---

9. Once all the truffles have all been dipped, repeat the rolling again to add a second, slightly thicker, layer of chocolate. Return to the baking parchment and allow to set.
---

10. Dust with a little cocoa powder if desired.
