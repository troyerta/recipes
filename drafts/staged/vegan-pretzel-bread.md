# Vegan Pretzel Bread

## Overview

- Yield: 2 loaves

## Ingredients

- 4 Cups all purpose flour

- 1/3 cup vegan butter melted

- 1 1/3 cup warm water not too hot, just above room temp

- 1 pinch salt

- coarse salt to decorate on top, optional

#### Yeast Proofing:

- 2 1/4 tsp of yeast + 1/2 tsp of sugar + 1/4 cup of warm water.

#### Alkaline Bath:

- 6 cups of water + 2 Tbsp of baking soda.

## Method

1. Take all your yeast proofing ingredients and mix them together. Set aside until it foams and doubles in size.
---

#### In Your Stand Mixer:

1. Mix your flour and salt.
---

2. Add the proofed yeast and melted butter.
---

3. Set your stand mixer to low speed and add your water very slowly.
---

4. Once you use all your water is used. Set the speed to high and let it do it's thing for 5-6 minutes.
---

5. Take your dough out. It should be very sticky.
---

6. Cut in 4 and shape it into 4 balls.
---

7. Spray a baking sheet with some oil, place your 4 dough balls in there, making sure that you space them by at least 3-4 inches.
---

8. Cover with a towel and let rise for 45 minutes or until it doubles in size.
---

9. Prepare your alkaline bath by putting the water (6 cups) in a large pot and bringing it to a boil. Add your baking soda.
---

10. Pre heat your oven to 375F.
---

11. Using a very sharp knife, make a a couple of incisions in your dough balls and boil them for 1-2 minutes each ONE AT A TIME. Boiling them one a time ensures that the temperature in your bath will not drop.
---

12. Lay some parchemin paper on a loaf pan, and put your dough balls one next the the other in the pan. I could only fit 2 in my pan. So this recipe made 2 loaves. Yaye !
---

13. If you don't have parchemin paper, you can just oil your loaf pan. Please note that this will make your pretzel loaf more crispy on the bottom and sides.
---

14. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes or until golden brown.
